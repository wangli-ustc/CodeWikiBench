This means that for certain events — see the list below — a single event listener at the application root takes responsibility for running any handlers on the event's path.\n\nThere are a few gotchas to be aware of:\n\n[\"when you manually dispatch an event with a delegated listener, make sure to set the `{ bubbles: true }` option or it won't reach the application root\", \"when using `addEventListener` directly, avoid calling `stopPropagation` or the event won't reach the application root and handlers won't be invoked. Similarly, handlers added manually inside the application root will run _before_ handlers added declaratively deeper in the DOM (with e.g. `onclick={...}`), in both capturing and bubbling phases. For these reasons it's better to use the `on` function imported from `svelte/events` rather than `addEventListener`, as it will ensure that order is preserved and `stopPropagation` is handled correctly.\"]\n\nThe following event handlers are delegated:\n\n['`beforeinput`', '`click`', '`change`', '`dblclick`', '`contextmenu`', '`focusin`', '`focusout`', '`input`', '`keydown`', '`keyup`', '`mousedown`', '`mousemove`', '`mouseout`', '`mouseover`', '`mouseup`', '`pointerdown`', '`pointermove`', '`pointerout`', '`pointerover`', '`pointerup`', '`touchend`', '`touchmove`', '`touchstart`']"

If you want to render HTML, use the `{@html}` tag instead.\n\n```\n{@html potentiallyUnsafeHtmlString}\n```\n\n['[!NOTE] Make sure that you either escape the passed string or only populate it with values that are under your control in order to prevent [XSS attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)']",

The `u` argument is equal to `1 - t`.\n\nThe function is called repeatedly _before_ the animation begins, with different `t` and `u` arguments.\n\n<!-- TODO: Types -->\n\n```\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<script>\n    import { cubicOut } from 'svelte/easing';\n\n    /**\n     * @param {HTMLElement} node\n     * @param {{ from: DOMRect; to: DOMRect }} states\n     * @param {any} params\n     */\n    function whizz(node, { from, to }, params) {\n        const dx = from.left - to.left;\n        const dy = from.top - to.top;\n\n        const d = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n\n        return {\n            delay: 0,\n            duration: Math.sqrt(d) * 120,\n            easing: cubicOut,\n            css: (t, u) => `transform: translate(${u * dx}px, ${u * dy}px) rotate(${t * 360}deg);`\n        };\n    }\n</script>\n\n{#each list as item, index (item)}\n    <div animate:whizz>{item}</div>\n{/each}\n```\n\nA custom animation function can also return a `tick` function, which is called _during_ the animation with the same `t` and `u` arguments.\n\n[\"[!NOTE] If it's possible to use `css` instead of `tick`, do so — web animations can run off the main thread, preventing jank on slower devices.\"]\n\n```\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<script>\n    import { cubicOut } from 'svelte/easing';\n\n    /**\n     * @param {HTMLElement} node\n     * @param {{ from: DOMRect; to: DOMRect }} states\n     * @param {any} params\n     */\n    function whizz(node, { from, to }, params) {\n        const dx = from.left - to.left;\n        const dy = from.top - to.top;\n\n        const d = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n\n        return {\n            delay: 0,\n            duration: Math.sqrt(d) * 120,\n            easing: cubicOut,\n            tick: (t, u) => Object.assign(node.style, { color: t > 0.5 ?

This is useful for combining local classes with props, for example:\n\n```\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n    let props = $props();\n</script>\n\n<button {...props} class={['cool-button', props.class]}>\n    {@render props.children?.()}\n</button>\n```\n\nThe user of this component has the same flexibility to use a mixture of objects, arrays and strings:\n\n```\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<script>\n    import Button from './Button.svelte';\n    let useTailwind = $state(false);\n</script>\n\n<Button\n    onclick={() => useTailwind = true}\n    class={{ 'bg-blue-700 sm:w-1/2': useTailwind }}\n>\n    Accept the inevitability of Tailwind\n</Button>\n```\n\nSince Svelte 5.19, Svelte also exposes the `ClassValue` type, which is the type of value that the `class` attribute on elements accept. This is useful if you want to use a type-safe class name in component props:\n\n```\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n    import type { ClassValue } from 'svelte/elements';\n\n    const props: { class: ClassValue } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<div class={['original', props.class]}>...</div>\n```"
            },

With runes, these use cases have greatly diminished.\n\n[\"when extracting logic, it's better to take advantage of runes' universal reactivity: You can use runes outside the top level of components and even place them into JavaScript or TypeScript files (using a `.svelte.js` or `.svelte.ts` file ending)\", 'when creating shared state, you can create a `$state` object containing the values you need and then manipulate said state']\n\n```\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport const userState = $state({\n    name: 'name',\n    /* ... */\n});\n```\n\n```\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<script>\n    import { userState } from './state.svelte.js';\n</script>\n\n<p>User name: {userState.name}</p>\n<button onclick={() => {\n    userState.name = 'new name';\n}}>\n    change name\n</button>\n```\n\nStores are still a good solution when you have complex asynchronous data streams or it's important to have more manual control over updating values or listening to changes. If you're familiar with RxJs and want to reuse that knowledge, the `$` also comes in handy for you.",

              "`writable`": "Function that creates a store which has values that can be set from 'outside' components. It gets created as an object with additional `set` and `update` methods.\n\n`set` is a method that takes one argument which is the value to be set. The store value gets set to the value of the argument if the store value is not already equal to it.\n\n`update` is a method that takes one argument which is a callback. The callback takes the existing store value as its argument and returns the new value to be set to the store.\n\n```\n/// file: store.js\nimport { writable } from 'svelte/store';\n\nconst count = writable(0);\n\ncount.subscribe((value) => {\n    console.log(value);\n}); // logs '0'\n\ncount.set(1); // logs '1'\n\ncount.update((n) => n + 1); // logs '2'\n```\n\nIf a function is passed as the second argument, it will be called when the number of subscribers goes from zero to one (but not from one to two, etc). That function will be passed a `set` function which changes the value of the store, and an `update` function which works like the `update` method on the store, taking a callback to calculate the store's new value from its old value. It must return a `stop` function that is called when the subscriber count goes from one to zero.\n\n```\n/// file: store.js\nimport { writable } from 'svelte/store';\n\nconst count = writable(0, () => {\n    console.log('got a subscriber');\n    return () => console.log('no more subscribers');\n});\n\ncount.set(1); // does nothing\n\nconst unsubscribe = count.subscribe((value) => {\n    console.log(value);\n}); // logs 'got a subscriber', then '1'\n\nunsubscribe(); // logs 'no more subscribers'\n```\n\nNote that the value of a `writable` is lost when it is destroyed, for example when the page is refreshed. However, you can write your own logic to sync the value to for example the `localStorage`.",

Such a store is called a _writable store_.\"]\n\nFor interoperability with RxJS Observables, the `.subscribe` method is also allowed to return an object with an `.unsubscribe` method, rather than return the unsubscription function directly.

              "Component testing": "It is possible to test your components in isolation using Vitest.\n\n[\"[!NOTE] Before writing component tests, think about whether you actually need to test the component, or if it's more about the logic _inside_ the component. If so, consider extracting out that logic to test it in isolation, without the overhead of a component\"]\n\nTo get started, install jsdom (a library that shims DOM APIs):\n\n```\nnpm install -D jsdom\n```\n\nThen adjust your `vite.config.js`:\n\n```\n/// file: vite.config.js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n    plugins: [\n        /* ... */\n    ],\n    test: {\n        // If you are testing components client-side, you need to setup a DOM environment.\n        // If not all your files should have this environment, you can use a\n        // `// @vitest-environment jsdom` comment at the top of the test files instead.\n        environment: 'jsdom'\n    },\n    // Tell Vitest to use the `browser` entry points in `package.json` files, even though it's running in Node\n    resolve: process.env.VITEST\n        ? {\n                conditions: ['browser']\n            }\n        : undefined\n});\n```\n\nAfter that, you can create a test file in which you import the component to test, interact with it programmatically and write expectations about the results:\n\n```\n/// file: component.test.js\nimport { flushSync, mount, unmount } from 'svelte';\nimport { expect, test } from 'vitest';\nimport Component from './Component.svelte';\n\ntest('Component', () => {\n    // Instantiate the component using Svelte's `mount` API\n    const component = mount(Component, {\n        target: document.body, // `document` exists because of jsdom\n        props: { initial: 0 }\n    });\n\n    expect(document.body.innerHTML).toBe('<button>0</button>');\n\n    // Click the button, then flush the changes so you can synchronously write expectations\n    document.body.querySelector('button').click();\n    flushSync();\n\n    expect(document.body.innerHTML).toBe('<button>1</button>');\n\n    // Remove the component from the DOM\n    unmount(component);\n});\n```\n\nWhile the process is very straightforward, it is also low level and somewhat brittle, as the precise structure of your component may change frequently. Tools like [@testing-library/svelte](https://testing-library.com/docs/svelte-testing-library/intro/) can help streamline your tests. The above test could be rewritten like this:\n\n```\n/// file: component.test.js\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/svelte';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport { expect, test } from 'vitest';\nimport Component from './Component.svelte';\n\ntest('Component', async () => {\n    const user = userEvent.setup();\n    render(Component);\n\n    const button = screen.getByRole('button');\n    expect(button).toHaveTextContent(0);\n\n    await user.click(button);\n    expect(button).toHaveTextContent(1);\n});\n```\n\nWhen writing component tests that involve two-way bindings, context or snippet props, it's best to create a wrapper component for your specific test and interact with that. `@testing-library/svelte` contains some [examples](https://testing-library.com/docs/svelte-testing-library/example)."

            "E2E tests using Playwright": "E2E (short for 'end to end') tests allow you to test your full application through the eyes of the user. This section uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as an example, but you can also use other solutions like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [NightwatchJS](https://nightwatchjs.org/).\n\nYou can use the Svelte CLI to [setup Playwright](/docs/cli/playwright) either during project creation or later on. You can also [set it up with `npm init playwright`](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro). Additionally, you may also want to install an IDE plugin such as [the VS Code extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) to be able to execute tests from inside your IDE.\n\nIf you've run `npm init playwright` or are not using Vite, you may need to adjust the Playwright config to tell Playwright what to do before running the tests - mainly starting your application at a certain port. For example:\n\n```\n/// file: playwright.config.js\nconst config = {\n    webServer: {\n        command: 'npm run build && npm run preview',\n        port: 4173\n    },\n    testDir: 'tests',\n    testMatch: /(.+\\.)?(test|spec)\\.[jt]s/\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\nYou can now start writing tests. These are totally unaware of Svelte as a framework, so you mainly interact with the DOM and write assertions.\n\n```\n// @errors: 2307 7031\n/// file: tests/hello-world.spec.js\nimport { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest('home page has expected h1', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/');\n    await expect(page.locator('h1')).toBeVisible();\n});\n```"

Sometimes you may want to use experimental attributes or custom events coming from an action. In these cases, TypeScript will throw a type error, saying that it does not know these types.

In that case, you are welcome to open an issue and/or a PR fixing it.\n\nIn case this is a custom or experimental attribute/event, you can enhance the typings by augmenting the `svelte/elements` module like this:\n\n```\n/// file: additional-svelte-typings.d.ts\nimport { HTMLButtonAttributes } from 'svelte/elements';\n\ndeclare module 'svelte/elements' {\n    // add a new element\n    export interface SvelteHTMLElements {\n        'custom-button': HTMLButtonAttributes;\n    }\n\n    // add a new global attribute that is available on all html elements\n    export interface HTMLAttributes<T> {\n        globalattribute?: string;\n    }\n\n    // add a new attribute for button elements\n    export interface HTMLButtonAttributes {\n        veryexperimentalattribute?: string;\n    }\n}\n\nexport {}; // ensure this is not an ambient module, else types will be overridden instead of augmented\n```\n\nThen make sure that the `d.ts` file is referenced in your `tsconfig.json`.

It is only created in the next tick after the `connectedCallback` is invoked. Properties assigned to the custom element before it is inserted into the DOM are temporarily saved and then set on component creation, so their values are not lost. The same does not work for invoking exported functions on the custom element though, they are only available after the element has mounted. If you need to invoke functions before component creation, you can work around it by using the [`extend` option](#Component-options).\n\nWhen a custom element written with Svelte is created or updated, the shadow DOM will reflect the value in the next tick, not immediately. This way updates can be batched, and DOM moves which temporarily (but synchronously) detach the element from the DOM don't lead to unmounting the inner component.\n\nThe inner Svelte component is destroyed in the next tick after the `disconnectedCallback` is invoked.",

This meant you had to learn an entirely separate reactivity model, and the result often wasn't as nice to work with.

In the example above, it may look like you can use the `item` slot prop in the `empty` slot, but that's not true\", \"named slots had to be applied to an element using the `slot` attribute. Sometimes you didn't want to create an element, so we had to add the `<svelte:fragment>` API\", \"named slots could also be applied to a component, which changed the semantics of where `let:` directives are available (even today us maintainers often don't know which way around it works)\"], \"Snippets solve all of these problems by being much more readable and clear. At the same time they're more powerful as they allow you to define sections of UI that you can render _anywhere_, not just passing them as props to a component.\"]"

In some cases this may be wrong and it's best to change this to use a `$derived` instead. In other cases it may be right, but since `$:` statements also ran on the server but `$effect` does not, it isn't safe to transform it as such. Instead, `run` is used as a stopgap solution. `run` mimics most of the characteristics of `$:`, in that it runs on the server once, and runs as `$effect.pre` on the client (`$effect.pre` runs _before_ changes are applied to the DOM; most likely you want to use `$effect` instead).\n\n```\n<script>\n    ---import { run } from 'svelte/legacy';---\n    ---run(() => {---\n    +++$effect(() => {+++\n        // some side effect code\n    })\n</script>\n```",

It doesn't do it because it's impossible to determine the actual intent of the code. As a rule of thumb you can often go with a combination of `$effect.pre` (runs at the same time as `beforeUpdate` did) and `tick` (imported from `svelte`, allows you to wait until changes are applied to the DOM and then do some work)."

In Svelte 5, this is no longer the case by default because most of the time you're using a tooling chain that takes care of it in other ways (like SvelteKit). If you need CSS to be returned from `render`, you can set the `css` compiler option to `'injected'` and it will add `<style>` elements to the `head`.",
              "Component typing changes": "The change from classes towards functions is also reflected in the typings: `SvelteComponent`, the base class from Svelte 4, is deprecated in favour of the new `Component` type which defines the function shape of a Svelte component. To manually define a component shape in a `d.ts` file:\n\n```\nimport type { Component } from 'svelte';\nexport declare const MyComponent: Component<{\n    foo: string;\n}>;\n```\n\nTo declare that a component of a certain type is required:\n\n```\nimport { ComponentA, ComponentB } from 'component-library';\n---import type { SvelteComponent } from 'svelte';---\n+++import type { Component } from 'svelte';+++\n\n---let C: typeof SvelteComponent<{ foo: string }> = $state(---\n+++let C: Component<{ foo: string }> = $state(+++\n    Math.random() ? ComponentA : ComponentB\n);\n```\n\nThe two utility types `ComponentEvents` and `ComponentType` are also deprecated. `ComponentEvents` is obsolete because events are defined as callback props now, and `ComponentType` is obsolete because the new `Component` type is the component type already (i.e. `ComponentType<SvelteComponent<{ prop: string }>>` is equivalent to `Component<{ prop: string }>`).",

Svelte 5 simplifies this which makes it easier to reason about as a developer. The rules are:\n\n['Whitespace between nodes is collapsed to one whitespace', 'Whitespace at the start and end of a tag is removed completely', 'Certain exceptions apply such as keeping whitespace inside `pre` tags']\n\nAs before, you can disable whitespace trimming by setting the `preserveWhitespace` option in your compiler settings or on a per-component basis in `<svelte:options>`.",

              "Bindings to component exports are not allowed": "Exports from runes mode components cannot be bound to directly. For example, having `export const foo = ...` in component `A` and then doing `<A bind:foo />` causes an error. Use `bind:this` instead — `<A bind:this={a} />` — and access the export as `a.foo`. This change makes things easier to reason about, as it enforces a clear separation between props and exports.",
              "Bindings need to be explicitly defined using `$bindable()`": "In Svelte 4 syntax, every property (declared via `export let`) is bindable, meaning you can `bind:` to it. In runes mode, properties are not bindable by default: you need to denote bindable props with the `$bindable` rune.\n\nIf a bindable property has a default value (e.g. `let { foo = $bindable('bar') } = $props();`), you need to pass a non-`undefined` value to that property if you're binding to it. This prevents ambiguous behavior — the parent and child must have the same value — and results in better performance (in Svelte 4, the default value was reflected back to the parent, resulting in wasteful additional render cycles).",
              "`accessors` option is ignored": "Setting the `accessors` option to `true` makes properties of a component directly accessible on the component instance.\n\n```\n<svelte:options accessors={true} />\n\n<script>\n    // available via componentInstance.name\n    export let name;\n</script>\n```\n\nIn runes mode, properties are never accessible on the component instance.

In Svelte 5, reactivity is determined at runtime rather than compile time, so you should define `value` as a reactive `$state` field on the `Foo` class. Wrapping `new Foo()` with `$state(...)` will have no effect — only vanilla objects and arrays are made deeply reactive.",
              "Touch and wheel events are passive": "When using `onwheel`, `onmousewheel`, `ontouchstart` and `ontouchmove` event attributes, the handlers are [passive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#using_passive_listeners) to align with browser defaults. This greatly improves responsiveness by allowing the browser to scroll the document immediately, rather than waiting to see if the event handler calls `event.preventDefault()`.\n\nIn the very rare cases that you need to prevent these event defaults, you should use [`on`](/docs/svelte/svelte-events#on) instead (for example inside an action).",

In runes mode, if you want to concatenate stuff you must wrap the value in quotes:\n\n```\n<Component prop=\"this{is}valid\" />\n```\n\nNote that Svelte 5 will also warn if you have a single expression wrapped in quotes, like `answer=\"{42}\"` — in Svelte 6, that will cause the value to be converted to a string, rather than passed as a number.",
              "HTML structure is stricter": "In Svelte 4, you were allowed to write HTML code that would be repaired by the browser when server-side rendering it. For example you could write this...\n\n```\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td>hi</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\n... and the browser would auto-insert a `<tbody>` element:\n\n```\n<table>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>hi</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\nSvelte 5 is more strict about the HTML structure and will throw a compiler error in cases where the browser would repair the DOM."

              ":is(...), :has(...), and :where(...) are scoped": "Previously, Svelte did not analyse selectors inside `:is(...)`, `:has(...)`, and `:where(...)`, effectively treating them as global. Svelte 5 analyses them in the context of the current component. Some selectors may now therefore be treated as unused if they were relying on this treatment. To fix this, use `:global(...)` inside the `:is(...)/:has(...)/:where(...)` selectors.\n\nWhen using Tailwind's `@apply` directive, add a `:global` selector to preserve rules that use Tailwind-generated `:is(...)` selectors:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```css\nmain +++:global+++ {\n    @apply bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900;\n}\n```",

You can read more detail [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10443).\n\nIn the event that you need to support ancient browsers that don't implement `:where`, you can manually alter the emitted CSS, at the cost of unpredictable specificity changes:\n\n```\n// @errors: 2552\ncss = css.replace(/:where\\((.+?)\\)/, '$1');\n```",

              "`contenteditable` behavior change": "If you have a `contenteditable` node with a corresponding binding _and_ a reactive value inside it (example: `<div contenteditable=true bind:textContent>count is {count}</div>`), then the value inside the contenteditable will not be updated by updates to `count` because the binding takes full control over the content immediately and it should only be updated through it.",
              "`oneventname` attributes no longer accept string values": "In Svelte 4, it was possible to specify event attributes on HTML elements as a string:\n\n```\n<button onclick=\"alert('hello')\">...</button>\n```\n\nThis is not recommended, and is no longer possible in Svelte 5, where properties like `onclick` replace `on:click` as the mechanism for adding event handlers.",
              "`null` and `undefined` become the empty string": "In Svelte 4, `null` and `undefined` were printed as the corresponding string. In 99 out of 100 cases you want this to become the empty string instead, which is also what most other frameworks out there do.

This is very costly: setting a `src` attribute (even if it evaluates to the same thing) causes images and iframes to be reloaded, and reinserting a large blob of HTML is slow.\n\nSince these mismatches are extremely rare, Svelte 5 assumes that the values are unchanged, but in development will warn you if they are not. To force an update you can do something like this:\n\n```\n<script>\n    let { markup, src } = $props();\n\n    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n        // stash the values...\n        const initial = { markup, src };\n\n        // unset them...\n        markup = src = undefined;\n\n        $effect(() => {\n            // ...and reset after we've mounted\n            markup = initial.markup;\n            src = initial.src;\n        });\n    }\n</script>\n\n{@html markup}\n<img {src} />\n```",

For backwards compatibility the `on:event` syntax is still supported and behaves the same as in Svelte 4.

It is important to note that not all logic belongs within a component - this includes concerns such as data transformation, cross-component state management, and logging, among others. Remember that the Svelte library has its own test suite, so you do not need to write tests to validate implementation details provided by Svelte.\n\nA Svelte application will typically have three different types of tests: Unit, Component, and End-to-End (E2E).\n\n_Unit Tests_: Focus on testing business logic in isolation. Often this is validating individual functions and edge cases. By minimizing the surface area of these tests they can be kept lean and fast, and by extracting as much logic as possible from your Svelte components more of your application can be covered using them. When creating a new SvelteKit project, you will be asked whether you would like to setup [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing. There are a number of other test runners that could be used as well.\n\n_Component Tests_: Validating that a Svelte component mounts and interacts as expected throughout its lifecycle requires a tool that provides a Document Object Model (DOM). Components can be compiled (since Svelte is a compiler and not a normal library) and mounted to allow asserting against element structure, listeners, state, and all the other capabilities provided by a Svelte component. Tools for component testing range from an in-memory implementation like jsdom paired with a test runner like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) to solutions that leverage an actual browser to provide a visual testing capability such as [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).\n\n_End-to-End Tests_: To ensure your users are able to interact with your application it is necessary to test it as a whole in a manner as close to production as possible. This is done by writing end-to-end (E2E) tests which load and interact with a deployed version of your application in order to simulate how the user will interact with your application. When creating a new SvelteKit project, you will be asked whether you would like to setup [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing. There are many other E2E test libraries available for use as well.\n\nSome resources for getting started with testing:\n\n['[Svelte docs on testing](/docs/svelte/testing)', '[Setup Vitest using the Svelte CLI](/docs/cli/vitest)', '[Svelte Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/svelte-testing-library/example/)', '[Svelte Component Testing in Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/svelte/overview)', '[Example using uvu test runner with JSDOM](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu/tree/master/examples/svelte)', '[Test Svelte components using Vitest & Playwright](https://davipon.hashnode.dev/test-svelte-component-using-vitest-playwright)', '[Component testing with WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/component-testing/svelte)']",
            "Is there a router?": "The official routing library is [SvelteKit](/docs/kit). SvelteKit provides a filesystem router, server-side rendering (SSR), and hot module reloading (HMR) in one easy-to-use package. It shares similarities with Next.js for React.\n\nHowever, you can use any router library. A lot of people use [page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js). There's also [navaid](https://github.com/lukeed/navaid), which is very similar. And [universal-router](https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router), which is isomorphic with child routes, but without built-in history support.\n\nIf you prefer a declarative HTML approach, there's the isomorphic [svelte-routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing) library and a fork of it called [svelte-navigator](https://github.com/mefechoel/svelte-navigator) containing some additional functionality.\n\nIf you need hash-based routing on the client side, check out the [hash option](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration#router) in SvelteKit, [svelte-spa-router](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router), or [abstract-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/).\n\n[Routify](https://routify.dev) is another filesystem-based router, similar to SvelteKit's router. Version 3 supports Svelte's native SSR.\n\nYou can see a [community-maintained list of routers on sveltesociety.dev](https://sveltesociety.dev/packages?category=routers).",
            "How do I write a mobile app with Svelte?": "While most mobile apps are written without using JavaScript, if you'd like to leverage your existing Svelte components and knowledge of Svelte when building mobile apps, you can turn a [SvelteKit SPA](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/single-page-apps) into a mobile app with [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/start/frontend/sveltekit/) or [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/solution/svelte). Mobile features like the camera, geolocation, and push notifications are available via plugins for both platforms.\n\nSvelte Native was an option available for Svelte 4, but note that Svelte 5 does not currently support it. Svelte Native lets you write NativeScript apps using Svelte components that contain [NativeScript UI components](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/) rather than DOM elements, which may be familiar for users coming from React Native.",
            "Can I tell Svelte not to remove my unused styles?": "No. Svelte removes the styles from the component and warns you about them in order to prevent issues that would otherwise arise.\n\nSvelte's component style scoping works by generating a class unique to the given component, adding it to the relevant elements in the component that are under Svelte's control, and then adding it to each of the selectors in that component's styles. When the compiler can't see what elements a style selector applies to, there would be two bad options for keeping it:\n\n[\"If it keeps the selector and adds the scoping class to it, the selector will likely not match the expected elements in the component, and they definitely won't if they were created by a child component or `{@html ...}`.\", 'If it keeps the selector without adding the scoping class to it, the given style will become a global style, affecting your entire page.']\n\nIf you need to style something that Svelte can't identify at compile time, you will need to explicitly opt into global styles by using `:global(...)`. But also keep in mind that you can wrap `:global(...)` around only part of a selector. `.foo :global(.bar) { ... }` will style any `.bar` elements that appear within the component's `.foo` elements. As long as there's some parent element in the current component to start from, partially global selectors like this will almost always be able to get you what you want.",
            "Is Svelte v2 still available?": "New features aren't being added to it, and bugs will probably only be fixed if they are extremely nasty or present some sort of security vulnerability.\n\nThe documentation is still available [here](https://v2.svelte.dev/guide).",
            "How do I do hot module reloading?": "We recommend using [SvelteKit](/docs/kit), which supports HMR out of the box and is built on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [svelte-hmr](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-hmr). There are also community plugins for [rollup](https://github.com/rixo/rollup-plugin-svelte-hot) and [webpack](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader)."

            "Server-side component API": "```\n// @noErrors\nconst result = Component.render(...)\n```\n\nUnlike client-side components, server-side components don't have a lifespan after you render them — their whole job is to create some HTML and CSS. For that reason, the API is somewhat different.\n\nA server-side component exposes a `render` method that can be called with optional props. It returns an object with `head`, `html`, and `css` properties, where `head` contains the contents of any `<svelte:head>` elements encountered.\n\nYou can import a Svelte component directly into Node using `svelte/register`.\n\n```\n// @noErrors\nrequire('svelte/register');\n\nconst App = require('./App.svelte').default;\n\nconst { head, html, css } = App.render({\n    answer: 42\n});\n```\n\nThe `.render()` method accepts the following parameters:\n\n| parameter | default | description                                        |\n| --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| `props`   | `{}`    | An object of properties to supply to the component |\n| `options` | `{}`    | An object of options                               |\n\nThe `options` object takes in the following options:\n\n| option    | default     | description                                                              |\n| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `context` | `new Map()` | A `Map` of root-level context key-value pairs to supply to the component |\n\n```\n// @noErrors\nconst { head, html, css } = App.render(\n    // props\n    { answer: 42 },\n    // options\n    {\n        context: new Map([['context-key', 'context-value']])\n    }\n);\n```\n\n['[!NOTE]\\nIn Svelte 5+, use [`render`](svelte-server#render) instead']"
