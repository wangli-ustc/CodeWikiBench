        "Selections": "You can select text with your mouse cursor, double click on a word or use the keyboard <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd>.\n\n**Format overlay:**\n\nThe format overlay is a pop up that automatically appears when you're selecting text. You can easily transform text and inline markdown but also remove formatting.\n\n![](assets/marktext-format-popup.png)\n\n['Bold', 'Italics', 'Underline', 'Strikethrough', 'Inline code', 'Inline math formulas', 'Create link', 'Create image', 'Remove formatting']\n\nFurther overlays are available for emojis, links, images and tables.",

Now you can select an entry and the line is transformed into the selected one.\n\n![](assets/marktext-quick-insert.png)\n\nLine transformer\n\nYou can transform a line into another type by clicking on the highlighted icon in the image below and select `Turn Into`. Furthermore, you can duplicate the selected line, create a paragraph above the selected line or delete the line.\n\n![](assets/marktext-line-transformer.png)\n\nTable tools\n\nIt's sometimes hard to write and manage tables in markdown. In MarkText you can press <kbd>CmdOrCtrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to get a table dialog and create a table with variable row and column count. Both row and column count can be changed via the table tools (first icon above the table) later if necessary. You can use all inline styles in a table cell and align the text via table tools at the top of the table.\n\n**Insert and delete rows and columns:**\n\nYou can insert or delete a new row or column by clicking on an existing cell and click on the menu on the right side for rows or bottom for columns.\n\n![](assets/marktext-table_drag_drop.png)\n\n**Move table cells:**\n\nYou can simply move a row or column by clicking on the cell menu (like above) and dragging it by holding your mouse left-button like this:\n\n![](assets/marktext-table-gif.gif)\n\nImage tools\n\n![](assets/marktext-image-viewer.png)\n\nMarkText provides an image viewer and a pop up to select and label images. You can resize any image by your mouse cursor and changes are applied in realtime. By clicking on an image or writing `![]()` a pop up is automatically shown that allows you to select an image from disk or paste a path or URL. Images can be automatically uploaded to cloud, moved to a relative or absolute path on disk. Even pasting images that are not located on disk is supported and these images are stored in the background. In addition, you can control the image alignment whether inline, left, centered or right.\n\n![](assets/marktext-image-popup.png)\n\nEmoji picker\n\nInstantly add emojis to your markdown document without long searches. During typing, we automatically refresh the list of available emojis.\n\n![](assets/marktext-emoji-picker.png)\n\nFocus mode\n\n![](assets/marktext-focus-mode.png)\n\nThe focus mode will help you to focus on the currently line only by fading out other lines. To activate the focus mode, simply press <kbd>CmdOrCtrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>.\n\nTypewriter mode\n\nIn typewriter mode, the cursor is always keep in the middle of the editor.",
        "File encoding": "MarkText tries to automatically detect the used file encoding and byte-order mark (BOM) when opening a file. The default encoding is UTF-8 that should support all needed characters but can be changed in settings. You can disable automatically encoding detection but then we assume that all files are UTF-8 encoded. The current used encoding can be shown via command palette and also changed there.",
        "Line endings": "MarkText automatically analyzes each file and detects the used line ending and can be changed via command palette too.",
        "Find and replace": "**Inside the editor:**\n\nTo quickly find a keyword in your document press <kbd>CmdOrCtrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to open the search pop up. Now you can search for text or replace the given keyword.\n\n**Search in opened folder:**\n\nMarkText provides a build-in filesystem explorer (tree view) with a fast file searcher. Type a keyword in the search bar and select the needed options like regex or case-insensitive search. That's all, now MarkText will search all markdown files in the opened root directory."

The source-code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/marktext/marktext).\n\nCan I use MarkText as note management/taking app?\n\nMarkText is a pure markdown editor without feature such as knowledge management and tags but yes, you can do this via the integrated filesystem explorer and task lists.\n\nWhere can I find documentation?\n\nDocumentation is currently under development.\n\n['[End-user documentation](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/blob/develop/docs/README.md)', '[Developer documentation](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/blob/develop/docs/dev/README.md)']\n\nCan I run a portable version of MarkText?\n\nYes, please see [here](PORTABLE.md) for further information.\n\nHow can I report bugs and problems\n\nYou can report bugs and problems via our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/issues). Please provide a detailed description of the problem to better solve the issue.\n\nI cannot launch MarkText on Linux (SUID sandbox)\n\n['*The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly.*']\n\nNormally, you should never get this error but if you disabled user namespaces, this error message may appears in the command output when launching MarkText. To solve the issue, that Chromium cannot start the sandbox (process), you can choose one of the following steps:\n\n['Enable Linux kernel user namespaces to use the preferred sandbox: `sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1`.', \"Set correct SUID sandbox helper binary permissions: `sudo chown root <path_to_marktext_dir>/chrome-sandbox && sudo chmod 4755 <path_to_marktext_dir>/chrome-sandbox`.

                "Commands": "A command can execute a procedure and is shown in the command palette or can be run from event bus. We distinguish between static commands that are defined at compile time (maybe completed at runtime) and dynamtic commands that are created at runtime. Static commands are pure objects that are listed as array and most dynamic commands are classes that need access to the editor or other components. Each command can have nestled subcommands that have the same properties like a command. A root command is the command from which all subcommands are loaded that are displayed on screen. You can change the root command by calling `bus.$emit('show-command-palette', <command-reference>)`. Please note: a root command has special requirements such as a `run` method.\n\n**Static command:**\n\n```\n{\n  id: 'file.new-tab', // Unique id\n  description: 'File: New Tab',\n  execute: async () => {\n    // Set `null` as first parameter to fake the sender event.\n    ipcRenderer.emit('mt::new-untitled-tab', null)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Dynamic command:**\n\nYou can use either a class or object at runtime to register a command via the bus event `CMD::register-command`. A simple class example can be found below or a more complex [here](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/blob/develop/src/renderer/commands/quickOpen.js).\n\n```\nexport class ExampleCommand {\n  constructor () {\n    this.id = 'example-id'\n    this.description = 'Example'\n  }\n\n  // Execute the command.\n  async execute () {\n    // No-op\n  }\n}\n\nexport class Example2Command {\n  constructor () {\n    this.id = 'example-2-id'\n    this.description = 'Example 2'\n    this.placeholder = '' // Textbox placeholder (optional)\n    this.title = '' // Tooltip (optional)\n    this.subcommands = [] // (optional)\n    this.subcommandSelectedIndex = -1 // Required if `subcommands` defined (optional)\n  }\n\n  // Prepare subcommands and run the command when the entry is set as root.\n  // `run` must prepare the `subcommands`.\n  // `run` is only required if the command can be loaded as root command. If\n  // `execute` and `run` are not defined but `subcommands` is defined the\n  // subcommands are automatically loaded when the command is selected. Please\n  // note that `subcommands` must be available and the command cannot be loaded\n  // as root command when no `run` method is available (optional).\n  run = async () => {\n    this.subcommands = [{\n      id: 'example-2-sub-1',\n      description: 'Subcommand 1',\n      execute: async () => {\n        // No-op\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'example-2-sub-2',\n      description: 'Subcommand 2',\n      execute: async () => {\n        // No-op\n      }\n    }]\n  }\n\n  // Run when the command palette is unloaded and the command is root.\n  unload = () => {\n    this.subcommands = []\n  }\n\n  // Handle search queries when the entry is root.
