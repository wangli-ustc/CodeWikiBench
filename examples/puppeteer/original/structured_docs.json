      "title": "FAQ",
      "description": null,
      "content": {
        "Q: Who maintains Puppeteer?": "The Chrome Browser Automation team maintains the library, but we'd love your help and\nexpertise on the project! See our\n[contributing guide](https://pptr.dev/contributing).",
        "Q: What is the status of cross-browser support?": "From Puppeteer v23.0.0 onwards Puppeteer provides support for both Chrome and Firefox.\n\nTo automate Chrome Puppeteer uses the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) by default, but it can\nalso be automated using WebDriver BiDi which is the default for automating Firefox.\n\nTo understand the subtle differences in API support refer to our\n[WebDriver BiDi guide](https://pptr.dev/webdriver-bidi).",
        "Q: Does Puppeteer support WebDriver BiDi?": "From Puppeteer v23.0.0 and up Puppeteer has production-ready support for WebDriver BiDi\nto automate both Chrome and Firefox.",
        "Q: Will keep Puppeteer supporting CDP?": "We are not going to stop supporting automation of Chrome with CDP - despite\nPuppeteer's support for WebDriver BiDi. To not break existing automations relying on CDP,\nbut also to keep enabling automation use-cases unique to Chrome and not standardized\nwith WebDriver BiDi.",
        "Q: What are Puppeteer’s goals and principles?": "The goals of the project are:\n\n['Provide a reference implementation that highlights the capabilities of the\\n[Chrome DevTools](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/)\\nand [WebDriver BiDi](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/) protocols.', 'Grow the adoption of automated cross-browser testing.', 'Help dogfood new DevTools Protocol and WebDriver BiDi features...and catch bugs!', 'Learn more about the pain points of automated browser testing and help fill\\nthose gaps.']\n\nWe adapt\n[Chromium principles](https://www.chromium.org/developers/core-principles) to\nhelp us drive product decisions:\n\n['**Speed**: Puppeteer has almost zero performance overhead over an automated\\npage.', '**Security**: Puppeteer operates off-process with respect to the browser, making\\nit safe to automate potentially malicious pages.', '**Stability**: Puppeteer should not be flaky and should not leak memory.', '**Simplicity**: Puppeteer provides a high-level API that’s easy to use,\\nunderstand, and debug.']",
        "Q: Is Puppeteer a replacement for Selenium?": "Puppeteer is a Node.js based reference implementation of how to automate browsers\nwith CDP and WebDriver BiDi - the same web standard the Selenium project is also\ncontributing to.\n\nThe Selenium project goes beyond what Puppeteer offers in multiple aspects: it provides\nbindings for more languages than just JavaScript and for example it also offers tooling\nto orchestrate automation at large, like Selenium Grid. Both is beyond Puppeteer's scope.\n\nThere are community projects that add capabilities to Puppeteer beyond its core,\nmaking things like testing more convenient. For example see:\n\n['[jest-puppeteer](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer) or', \"[Puppeteer's Angular integration](https://pptr.dev/integrations/ng-schematics)\"]",
        "Q: Why doesn’t Puppeteer v.XXX work with a certain version of Chrome or Firefox?": "Every Puppeteer release is tightly bundled with a specific browser release\nto ensure compatibility with the implementation of the underlying protocols,\nthe Chrome DevTools Protocol and WebDriver BiDi.\n\nThis is to prevent changes in either [Chrome](https://pptr.dev/supported-browsers#chrome) or [Firefox](https://pptr.dev/supported-browsers#firefox) from unexpectedly breaking Puppeteer.",
        "Q: Which Chrome and Firefox version does Puppeteer use?": "Look for the `chrome` and `firefox` entries in\n[revisions.ts](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/packages/puppeteer-core/src/revisions.ts).",
        "Q: What’s considered a “Navigation”?": "From Puppeteer’s standpoint, **“navigation” is anything that changes a page’s\nURL**. Aside from regular navigation where the browser hits the network to fetch\na new document from the web server, this includes\n[anchor navigations](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/single-page.html#scroll-to-fragid)\nand [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)\nusage.\n\nWith this definition of “navigation,” **Puppeteer works seamlessly with\nsingle-page applications.**",
        "Q: What’s the difference between a “trusted\" and \"untrusted\" input event?": "In browsers, input events could be divided into two big groups: trusted vs.\nuntrusted.\n\n['**Trusted events**: events generated by users interacting with the page, e.g.\\nusing a mouse or keyboard.', '**Untrusted event**: events generated by Web APIs, e.g. `document.createEvent`\\nor `element.click()` methods.']\n\nWebsites can distinguish between these two groups:\n\n['using an\\n[`Event.isTrusted`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted)\\nevent flag', \"sniffing for accompanying events. For example, every trusted `'click'` event\\nis preceded by `'mousedown'` and `'mouseup'` events.\"]\n\nFor automation purposes it’s important to generate trusted events. **All input\nevents generated with Puppeteer are trusted and fire proper accompanying\nevents.** If, for some reason, one needs an untrusted event, it’s always\npossible to hop into a page context with `page.evaluate` and generate a fake\nevent:\n\n```\nawait page.evaluate(() => {\n  document.querySelector('button[type=submit]').click();\n});\n```",
        "Q: Does Puppeteer support media and audio playback?": "Puppeteer uses [Chrome for Testing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) binaries\nby default which ship with properietary codecs support starting from\n[M120](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/12d607016c31ea13579e897740c765be189ed6eb).",
        "Q: I am having trouble installing / running Puppeteer in my test environment. Where should I look for help?": "We have a\n[troubleshooting](https://pptr.dev/troubleshooting)\nguide for various operating systems that lists the required dependencies.",
        "Q: I have more questions! Where do I ask?": "There are many ways to get help on Puppeteer:\n\n['For questions: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/puppeteer)', 'For bug reports: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues)']\n\nMake sure to search these channels before posting your question."

For the former,\nwe do not support deprecated versions of Node.js.

Generally the home directory is well-defined (even\non Windows), but occasionally the home directory may not be available. In this\ncase, we provide the `PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR` variable which allows you to change\nthe installation directory.\n\nFor example,\n\n```\nPUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR=$(pwd) npm install puppeteer\nPUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR=$(pwd) node <script-path>\n```\n\nYou can also create a configuration file named `.puppeteerrc.cjs` (or\n`puppeteer.config.cjs`) at the root of your application with the contents\n\n```\nconst {join} = require('path');\n\n/**\n * @type {import(\"puppeteer\").Configuration}\n */\nmodule.exports = {\n  cacheDirectory: join(__dirname, '.cache', 'puppeteer'),\n};\n```\n\nYou will need to reinstall `puppeteer` in order for the configuration to take\neffect.

When the\nerror occurs, a warning page is shown to the user with a button to continue\nnavigation. The button is clickable via Puppeteer. Local HTTP hosts do not\ntrigger a warning but remote hosts might. For more details see\nhttps://crbug.com/378022921\n\nIt is possible to disable this Chrome feature by passing the\n`--disable-features=HttpsFirstBalancedModeAutoEnable` argument when launching\nChrome:\n\n```\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({\n  args: ['--disable-features=HttpsFirstBalancedModeAutoEnable'],\n});\n```",

The accessibility tree is used by assistive technology such as [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) or [switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access).\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nAccessibility is a very platform-specific thing. On different platforms, there are different screen readers that might have wildly different output.\n\nBlink - Chrome's rendering engine - has a concept of \"accessibility tree\", which is then translated into different platform-specific APIs. Accessibility namespace gives users access to the Blink Accessibility Tree.\n\nMost of the accessibility tree gets filtered out when converting from Blink AX Tree to Platform-specific AX-Tree or by assistive technologies themselves. By default, Puppeteer tries to approximate this filtering, exposing only the \"interesting\" nodes of the tree.\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Accessibility` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"browser\">[Browser](./puppeteer.browser.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\n[Browser](./puppeteer.browser.md) represents a browser instance that is either:\n\n['connected to via [Puppeteer.connect()](./puppeteer.puppeteer.connect.md) or - launched by [PuppeteerNode.launch()](./puppeteer.puppeteernode.launch.md).']\n\n[Browser](./puppeteer.browser.md) [emits](./puppeteer.eventemitter.emit.md) various events which are documented in the [BrowserEvent](./puppeteer.browserevent.md) enum.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Browser` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"browsercontext\">[BrowserContext](./puppeteer.browsercontext.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\n[BrowserContext](./puppeteer.browsercontext.md) represents individual user contexts within a [browser](./puppeteer.browser.md).\n\nWhen a [browser](./puppeteer.browser.md) is launched, it has at least one default [browser context](./puppeteer.browsercontext.md). Others can be created using [Browser.createBrowserContext()](./puppeteer.browser.createbrowsercontext.md). Each context has isolated storage (cookies/localStorage/etc.)\n\n[BrowserContext](./puppeteer.browsercontext.md) [emits](./puppeteer.eventemitter.md) various events which are documented in the [BrowserContextEvent](./puppeteer.browsercontextevent.md) enum.\n\nIf a [page](./puppeteer.page.md) opens another [page](./puppeteer.page.md), e.g. using `window.open`, the popup will belong to the parent [page's browser context](./puppeteer.page.browsercontext.md).\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nIn Chrome all non-default contexts are incognito, and [default browser context](./puppeteer.browser.defaultbrowsercontext.md) might be incognito if you provide the `--incognito` argument when launching the browser.\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `BrowserContext` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"browserlauncher\">[BrowserLauncher](./puppeteer.browserlauncher.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nDescribes a launcher - a class that is able to create and launch a browser instance.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal.

Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `DeviceRequestPrompt` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"devicerequestpromptdevice\">[DeviceRequestPromptDevice](./puppeteer.devicerequestpromptdevice.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nDevice in a request prompt.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal.

Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Dialog` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"elementhandle\">[ElementHandle](./puppeteer.elementhandle.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nElementHandle represents an in-page DOM element.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nElementHandles can be created with the [Page.$()](./puppeteer.page._.md) method.\n\n```\nimport puppeteer from 'puppeteer';\n\n(async () => {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  const hrefElement = await page.$('a');\n  await hrefElement.click();\n  // ...\n})();\n```\n\nElementHandle prevents the DOM element from being garbage-collected unless the handle is [disposed](./puppeteer.jshandle.dispose.md). ElementHandles are auto-disposed when their origin frame gets navigated.\n\nElementHandle instances can be used as arguments in [Page.$eval()](./puppeteer.page._eval.md) and [Page.evaluate()](./puppeteer.page.evaluate.md) methods.\n\nIf you're using TypeScript, ElementHandle takes a generic argument that denotes the type of element the handle is holding within. For example, if you have a handle to a `<select>` element, you can type it as `ElementHandle<HTMLSelectElement>` and you get some nicer type checks.\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `ElementHandle` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"eventemitter\">[EventEmitter](./puppeteer.eventemitter.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nThe EventEmitter class that many Puppeteer classes extend.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThis allows you to listen to events that Puppeteer classes fire and act accordingly. Therefore you'll mostly use [on](./puppeteer.eventemitter.on.md) and [off](./puppeteer.eventemitter.off.md) to bind and unbind to event listeners.\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `EventEmitter` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"extensiontransport\">[ExtensionTransport](./puppeteer.extensiontransport.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\n**_(Experimental)_** Experimental ExtensionTransport allows establishing a connection via chrome.debugger API if Puppeteer runs in an extension. Since Chrome DevTools Protocol is restricted for extensions, the transport implements missing commands and events.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `ExtensionTransport` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"filechooser\">[FileChooser](./puppeteer.filechooser.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nFile choosers let you react to the page requesting for a file.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\n`FileChooser` instances are returned via the [Page.waitForFileChooser()](./puppeteer.page.waitforfilechooser.md) method.\n\nIn browsers, only one file chooser can be opened at a time. All file choosers must be accepted or canceled. Not doing so will prevent subsequent file choosers from appearing.\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `FileChooser` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"frame\">[Frame](./puppeteer.frame.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nRepresents a DOM frame.\n\nTo understand frames, you can think of frames as `<iframe>` elements. Just like iframes, frames can be nested, and when JavaScript is executed in a frame, the JavaScript does not affect frames inside the ambient frame the JavaScript executes in.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nFrame lifecycles are controlled by three events that are all dispatched on the parent [page](./puppeteer.frame.page.md):\n\n['[PageEvent.FrameAttached](./puppeteer.pageevent.md) - [PageEvent.FrameNavigated](./puppeteer.pageevent.md) - [PageEvent.FrameDetached](./puppeteer.pageevent.md)']\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Frame` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"httprequest\">[HTTPRequest](./puppeteer.httprequest.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nRepresents an HTTP request sent by a page.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nWhenever the page sends a request, such as for a network resource, the following events are emitted by Puppeteer's `page`:\n\n['`request`: emitted when the request is issued by the page.', '`requestfinished` - emitted when the response body is downloaded and the request is complete.']\n\nIf request fails at some point, then instead of `requestfinished` event the `requestfailed` event is emitted.\n\nAll of these events provide an instance of `HTTPRequest` representing the request that occurred:\n\n```\npage.on('request', request => ...)\n```\n\nNOTE: HTTP Error responses, such as 404 or 503, are still successful responses from HTTP standpoint, so request will complete with `requestfinished` event.\n\nIf request gets a 'redirect' response, the request is successfully finished with the `requestfinished` event, and a new request is issued to a redirected url.\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `HTTPRequest` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"httpresponse\">[HTTPResponse](./puppeteer.httpresponse.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nThe HTTPResponse class represents responses which are received by the [Page](./puppeteer.page.md) class.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `HTTPResponse` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"jscoverage\">[JSCoverage](./puppeteer.jscoverage.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `JSCoverage` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"jshandle\">[JSHandle](./puppeteer.jshandle.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nRepresents a reference to a JavaScript object. Instances can be created using [Page.evaluateHandle()](./puppeteer.page.evaluatehandle.md).\n\nHandles prevent the referenced JavaScript object from being garbage-collected unless the handle is purposely [disposed](./puppeteer.jshandle.dispose.md). JSHandles are auto-disposed when their associated frame is navigated away or the parent context gets destroyed.\n\nHandles can be used as arguments for any evaluation function such as [Page.$eval()](./puppeteer.page._eval.md), [Page.evaluate()](./puppeteer.page.evaluate.md), and [Page.evaluateHandle()](./puppeteer.page.evaluatehandle.md). They are resolved to their referenced object.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `JSHandle` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"keyboard\">[Keyboard](./puppeteer.keyboard.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nKeyboard provides an api for managing a virtual keyboard. The high level api is [Keyboard.type()](./puppeteer.keyboard.type.md), which takes raw characters and generates proper keydown, keypress/input, and keyup events on your page.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nFor finer control, you can use [Keyboard.down()](./puppeteer.keyboard.down.md), [Keyboard.up()](./puppeteer.keyboard.up.md), and [Keyboard.sendCharacter()](./puppeteer.keyboard.sendcharacter.md) to manually fire events as if they were generated from a real keyboard.\n\nOn macOS, keyboard shortcuts like `⌘ A` -&gt; Select All do not work. See [\\#1313](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/1313).\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Keyboard` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"locator\">[Locator](./puppeteer.locator.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nLocators describe a strategy of locating objects and performing an action on them. If the action fails because the object is not ready for the action, the whole operation is retried. Various preconditions for a successful action are checked automatically.\n\nSee [https://pptr.dev/guides/page-interactions\\#locators](https://pptr.dev/guides/page-interactions#locators) for details.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"mouse\">[Mouse](./puppeteer.mouse.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nThe Mouse class operates in main-frame CSS pixels relative to the top-left corner of the viewport.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nEvery `page` object has its own Mouse, accessible with [Page.mouse](./puppeteer.page.md#mouse).\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Mouse` class.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n<span id=\"page\">[Page](./puppeteer.page.md)</span>\n\n</td><td>\n\nPage provides methods to interact with a single tab or [extension background page](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages) in the browser.\n\n:::note\n\nOne Browser instance might have multiple Page instances.\n\n:::\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal.

ElementHandles are auto-disposed when their origin frame gets navigated.\n\nElementHandle instances can be used as arguments in [Page.$eval()](./puppeteer.page._eval.md) and [Page.evaluate()](./puppeteer.page.evaluate.md) methods.\n\nIf you're using TypeScript, ElementHandle takes a generic argument that denotes the type of element the handle is holding within. For example, if you have a handle to a `<select>` element, you can type it as `ElementHandle<HTMLSelectElement>` and you get some nicer type checks.\n\nThe constructor for this class is marked as internal.

            "Example 1": "```\n// Using ‘page.mouse’ to trace a 100x100 square.\nawait page.mouse.move(0, 0);\nawait page.mouse.down();\nawait page.mouse.move(0, 100);\nawait page.mouse.move(100, 100);\nawait page.mouse.move(100, 0);\nawait page.mouse.move(0, 0);\nawait page.mouse.up();\n```\n\n**Note**: The mouse events trigger synthetic `MouseEvent`s. This means that it does not fully replicate the functionality of what a normal user would be able to do with their mouse.\n\nFor example, dragging and selecting text is not possible using `page.mouse`. Instead, you can use the [\\`DocumentOrShadowRoot.getSelection()\\`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentOrShadowRoot/getSelection) functionality implemented in the platform.",
            "Example 2": "For example, if you want to select all content between nodes:\n\n```\nawait page.evaluate(\n  (from, to) => {\n    const selection = from.getRootNode().getSelection();\n    const range = document.createRange();\n    range.setStartBefore(from);\n    range.setEndAfter(to);\n    selection.removeAllRanges();\n    selection.addRange(range);\n  },\n  fromJSHandle,\n  toJSHandle,\n);\n```\n\nIf you then would want to copy-paste your selection, you can use the clipboard api:\n\n```\n// The clipboard api does not allow you to copy, unless the tab is focused.\nawait page.bringToFront();\nawait page.evaluate(() => {\n  // Copy the selected content to the clipboard\n  document.execCommand('copy');\n  // Obtain the content of the clipboard as a string\n  return navigator.clipboard.readText();\n});\n```\n\n**Note**: If you want access to the clipboard API, you have to give it permission to do so:\n\n```\nawait browser\n  .defaultBrowserContext()\n  .overridePermissions('<your origin>', ['clipboard-read', 'clipboard-write']);\n```",

On different platforms, there are different screen readers that might have wildly different output.\n\nBlink - Chrome's rendering engine - has a concept of \"accessibility tree\", which is then translated into different platform-specific APIs. Accessibility namespace gives users access to the Blink Accessibility Tree.\n\nMost of the accessibility tree gets filtered out when converting from Blink AX Tree to Platform-specific AX-Tree or by assistive technologies themselves.

            "Multiple Intercept Handlers and Asynchronous Resolutions": "By default Puppeteer will raise a `Request is already handled!` exception if\n`request.abort`, `request.continue`, or `request.respond` are called after any\nof them have already been called.\n\nAlways assume that an unknown handler may have already called\n`abort/continue/respond`. Even if your handler is the only one you registered,\n3rd party packages may register their own handlers. It is therefore important to\nalways check the resolution status using\n[request.isInterceptResolutionHandled](../api/puppeteer.httprequest.isinterceptresolutionhandled)\nbefore calling `abort/continue/respond`.\n\nImportantly, the intercept resolution may get handled by another listener while\nyour handler is awaiting an asynchronous operation. Therefore, the return value\nof `request.isInterceptResolutionHandled` is only safe in a synchronous code\nblock. Always execute `request.isInterceptResolutionHandled` and\n`abort/continue/respond` **synchronously** together.\n\nThis example demonstrates two synchronous handlers working together:\n\n```\n/*\nThis first handler will succeed in calling request.continue because the request interception has never been resolved.\n*/\npage.on('request', interceptedRequest => {\n  if (interceptedRequest.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n  interceptedRequest.continue();\n});\n\n/*\nThis second handler will return before calling request.abort because request.continue was already\ncalled by the first handler.\n*/\npage.on('request', interceptedRequest => {\n  if (interceptedRequest.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n  interceptedRequest.abort();\n});\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates asynchronous handlers working together:\n\n```\n/*\nThis first handler will succeed in calling request.continue because the request interception has never been resolved.\n*/\npage.on('request', interceptedRequest => {\n  // The interception has not been handled yet. Control will pass through this guard.\n  if (interceptedRequest.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // It is not strictly necessary to return a promise, but doing so will allow Puppeteer to await this handler.\n  return new Promise(resolve => {\n    // Continue after 500ms\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      // Inside, check synchronously to verify that the intercept wasn't handled already.\n      // It might have been handled during the 500ms while the other handler awaited an async op of its own.\n      if (interceptedRequest.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) {\n        resolve();\n        return;\n      }\n      interceptedRequest.continue();\n      resolve();\n    }, 500);\n  });\n});\npage.on('request', async interceptedRequest => {\n  // The interception has not been handled yet. Control will pass through this guard.\n  if (interceptedRequest.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  await someLongAsyncOperation();\n  // The interception *MIGHT* have been handled by the first handler, we can't be sure.\n  // Therefore, we must check again before calling continue() or we risk Puppeteer raising an exception.\n  if (interceptedRequest.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n  interceptedRequest.continue();\n});\n```\n\nFor finer-grained introspection (see Cooperative Intercept Mode below), you may\nalso call\n[request.interceptResolutionState](../api/puppeteer.httprequest.interceptresolutionstate)\nsynchronously before using `abort/continue/respond`.\n\nHere is the example above rewritten using `request.interceptResolutionState`\n\n```\n/*\nThis first handler will succeed in calling request.continue because the request interception has never been resolved.\n*/\npage.on('request', interceptedRequest => {\n  // The interception has not been handled yet. Control will pass through this guard.\n  const {action} = interceptedRequest.interceptResolutionState();\n  if (action === InterceptResolutionAction.AlreadyHandled) return;\n\n  // It is not strictly necessary to return a promise, but doing so will allow Puppeteer to await this handler.\n  return new Promise(resolve => {\n    // Continue after 500ms\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      // Inside, check synchronously to verify that the intercept wasn't handled already.\n      // It might have been handled during the 500ms while the other handler awaited an async op of its own.\n      const {action} = interceptedRequest.interceptResolutionState();\n      if (action === InterceptResolutionAction.AlreadyHandled) {\n        resolve();\n        return;\n      }\n      interceptedRequest.continue();\n      resolve();\n    }, 500);\n  });\n});\npage.on('request', async interceptedRequest => {\n  // The interception has not been handled yet. Control will pass through this guard.\n  if (\n    interceptedRequest.interceptResolutionState().action ===\n    InterceptResolutionAction.AlreadyHandled\n  )\n    return;\n\n  await someLongAsyncOperation();\n  // The interception *MIGHT* have been handled by the first handler, we can't be sure.\n  // Therefore, we must check again before calling continue() or we risk Puppeteer raising an exception.\n  if (\n    interceptedRequest.interceptResolutionState().action ===\n    InterceptResolutionAction.AlreadyHandled\n  )\n    return;\n  interceptedRequest.continue();\n});\n```",
            "Cooperative Intercept Mode": "`request.abort`, `request.continue`, and `request.respond` can accept an\noptional `priority` to work in Cooperative Intercept Mode. When all handlers are\nusing Cooperative Intercept Mode, Puppeteer guarantees that all intercept\nhandlers will run and be awaited in order of registration. The interception is\nresolved to the highest-priority resolution. Here are the rules of Cooperative\nIntercept Mode:\n\n['All resolutions must supply a numeric `priority` argument to\\n`abort/continue/respond`.', 'If any resolution does not supply a numeric `priority`, Legacy Mode is active\\nand Cooperative Intercept Mode is inactive.', 'Async handlers finish before intercept resolution is finalized.', 'The highest priority interception resolution \"wins\", i.e. the interception is\\nultimately aborted/responded/continued according to which resolution was given\\nthe highest priority.', 'In the event of a tie, `abort` > `respond` > `continue`.']\n\nFor standardization, when specifying a Cooperative Intercept Mode priority use\n`0` or `DEFAULT_INTERCEPT_RESOLUTION_PRIORITY` (exported from `HTTPRequest`)\nunless you have a clear reason to use a higher priority. This gracefully prefers\n`respond` over `continue` and `abort` over `respond` and allows other handlers\nto work cooperatively. If you do intentionally want to use a different priority,\nhigher priorities win over lower priorities. Negative priorities are allowed.\nFor example, `continue({}, 4)` would win over `continue({}, -2)`.\n\nTo preserve backward compatibility, any handler resolving the intercept without\nspecifying `priority` (Legacy Mode) causes immediate resolution. For Cooperative\nIntercept Mode to work, all resolutions must use a `priority`. In practice, this\nmeans you must still test for `request.isInterceptResolutionHandled` because a\nhandler beyond your control may have called `abort/continue/respond` without a\npriority (Legacy Mode).\n\nIn this example, Legacy Mode prevails and the request is aborted immediately\nbecause at least one handler omits `priority` when resolving the intercept:\n\n```\n// Final outcome: immediate abort()\npage.setRequestInterception(true);\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Legacy Mode: interception is aborted immediately.\n  request.abort('failed');\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n  // Control will never reach this point because the request was already aborted in Legacy Mode\n\n  // Cooperative Intercept Mode: votes for continue at priority 0.\n  request.continue({}, 0);\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, Legacy Mode prevails and the request is continued because at\nleast one handler does not specify a `priority`:\n\n```\n// Final outcome: immediate continue()\npage.setRequestInterception(true);\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Cooperative Intercept Mode: votes to abort at priority 0.\n  request.abort('failed', 0);\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Control reaches this point because the request was cooperatively aborted which postpones resolution.\n\n  // { action: InterceptResolutionAction.Abort, priority: 0 }, because abort @ 0 is the current winning resolution\n  console.log(request.interceptResolutionState());\n\n  // Legacy Mode: intercept continues immediately.\n  request.continue({});\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  // { action: InterceptResolutionAction.AlreadyHandled }, because continue in Legacy Mode was called\n  console.log(request.interceptResolutionState());\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, Cooperative Intercept Mode is active because all handlers\nspecify a `priority`. `continue()` wins because it has a higher priority than\n`abort()`.\n\n```\n// Final outcome: cooperative continue() @ 5\npage.setRequestInterception(true);\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Cooperative Intercept Mode: votes to abort at priority 10\n  request.abort('failed', 0);\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Cooperative Intercept Mode: votes to continue at priority 5\n  request.continue(request.continueRequestOverrides(), 5);\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  // { action: InterceptResolutionAction.Continue, priority: 5 }, because continue @ 5 > abort @ 0\n  console.log(request.interceptResolutionState());\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, Cooperative Intercept Mode is active because all handlers\nspecify `priority`. `respond()` wins because its priority ties with\n`continue()`, but `respond()` beats `continue()`.\n\n```\n// Final outcome: cooperative respond() @ 15\npage.setRequestInterception(true);\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Cooperative Intercept Mode: votes to abort at priority 10\n  request.abort('failed', 10);\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Cooperative Intercept Mode: votes to continue at priority 15\n  request.continue(request.continueRequestOverrides(), 15);\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Cooperative Intercept Mode: votes to respond at priority 15\n  request.respond(request.responseForRequest(), 15);\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n\n  // Cooperative Intercept Mode: votes to respond at priority 12\n  request.respond(request.responseForRequest(), 12);\n});\npage.on('request', request => {\n  // { action: InterceptResolutionAction.Respond, priority: 15 }, because respond @ 15 > continue @ 15 > respond @ 12 > abort @ 10\n  console.log(request.interceptResolutionState());\n});\n```",
            "Cooperative Request Continuation": "Puppeteer requires `request.continue()` to be called explicitly or the request\nwill hang. Even if your handler means to take no special action, or 'opt out',\n`request.continue()` must still be called.\n\nWith the introduction of Cooperative Intercept Mode, two use cases arise for\ncooperative request continuations: Unopinionated and Opinionated.\n\nThe first case (common) is that your handler means to opt out of doing anything\nspecial the request. It has no opinion on further action and simply intends to\ncontinue by default and/or defer to other handlers that might have an opinion.\nBut in case there are no other handlers, we must call `request.continue()` to\nensure that the request doesn't hang.\n\nWe call this an **Unopinionated continuation** because the intent is to continue\nthe request if nobody else has a better idea. Use\n`request.continue({...}, DEFAULT_INTERCEPT_RESOLUTION_PRIORITY)` (or `0`) for\nthis type of continuation.\n\nThe second case (uncommon) is that your handler actually does have an opinion\nand means to force continuation by overriding a lower-priority `abort()` or\n`respond()` issued elsewhere. We call this an **Opinionated continuation**. In\nthese rare cases where you mean to specify an overriding continuation priority,\nuse a custom priority.\n\nTo summarize, reason through whether your use of `request.continue` is just\nmeant to be default/bypass behavior vs falling within the intended use case of\nyour handler. Consider using a custom priority for in-scope use cases, and a\ndefault priority otherwise. Be aware that your handler may have both Opinionated\nand Unopinionated cases.",
            "Upgrading to Cooperative Intercept Mode for package maintainers": "If you are package maintainer and your package uses intercept handlers, you can\nupdate your intercept handlers to use Cooperative Intercept Mode. Suppose you\nhave the following existing handler:\n\n```\npage.on('request', interceptedRequest => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n  if (\n    interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.png') ||\n    interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.jpg')\n  )\n    interceptedRequest.abort();\n  else interceptedRequest.continue();\n});\n```\n\nTo use Cooperative Intercept Mode, upgrade `continue()` and `abort()`:\n\n```\npage.on('request', interceptedRequest => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n  if (\n    interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.png') ||\n    interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.jpg')\n  )\n    interceptedRequest.abort('failed', 0);\n  else\n    interceptedRequest.continue(\n      interceptedRequest.continueRequestOverrides(),\n      0,\n    );\n});\n```\n\nWith those simple upgrades, your handler now uses Cooperative Intercept Mode\ninstead.\n\nHowever, we recommend a slightly more robust solution because the above\nintroduces several subtle issues:\n\n['**Backward compatibility.** If any handler still uses a Legacy Mode\\nresolution (ie, does not specify a priority), that handler will resolve the\\ninterception immediately even if your handler runs first. This could cause\\ndisconcerting behavior for your users because suddenly your handler is not\\nresolving the interception and a different handler is taking priority when\\nall the user did was upgrade your package.', '**Hard-coded priority.** Your package user has no ability to specify the\\ndefault resolution priority for your handlers. This can become important when\\nthe user wishes to manipulate the priorities based on use case. For example,\\none user might want your package to take a high priority while another user\\nmight want it to take a low priority.']\n\nTo resolve both of these issues, our recommended approach is to export a\n`setInterceptResolutionConfig()` from your package. The user can then call\n`setInterceptResolutionConfig()` to explicitly activate Cooperative Intercept\nMode in your package so they aren't surprised by changes in how the interception\nis resolved. They can also optionally specify a custom priority using\n`setInterceptResolutionConfig(priority)` that works for their use case:\n\n```\n// Defaults to undefined which preserves Legacy Mode behavior\nlet _priority = undefined;\n\n// Export a module configuration function\nexport const setInterceptResolutionConfig = (priority = 0) =>\n  (_priority = priority);\n\n/**\n * Note that this handler uses `DEFAULT_INTERCEPT_RESOLUTION_PRIORITY` to \"pass\" on this request. It is important to use\n * the default priority when your handler has no opinion on the request and the intent is to continue() by default.\n */\npage.on('request', interceptedRequest => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n  if (\n    interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.png') ||\n    interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.jpg')\n  )\n    interceptedRequest.abort('failed', _priority);\n  else\n    interceptedRequest.continue(\n      interceptedRequest.continueRequestOverrides(),\n      DEFAULT_INTERCEPT_RESOLUTION_PRIORITY, // Unopinionated continuation\n    );\n});\n```\n\nIf your package calls for more fine-grained control over resolution priorities,\nuse a config pattern like this:\n\n```\ninterface InterceptResolutionConfig {\n  abortPriority?: number;\n  continuePriority?: number;\n}\n\n// This approach supports multiple priorities based on situational\n// differences. You could, for example, create a config that\n// allowed separate priorities for PNG vs JPG.\nconst DEFAULT_CONFIG: InterceptResolutionConfig = {\n  abortPriority: undefined, // Default to Legacy Mode\n  continuePriority: undefined, // Default to Legacy Mode\n};\n\n// Defaults to undefined which preserves Legacy Mode behavior\nlet _config: Partial<InterceptResolutionConfig> = {};\n\nexport const setInterceptResolutionConfig = (\n  config: InterceptResolutionConfig,\n) => (_config = {...DEFAULT_CONFIG, ...config});\n\npage.on('request', interceptedRequest => {\n  if (request.isInterceptResolutionHandled()) return;\n  if (\n    interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.png') ||\n    interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.jpg')\n  ) {\n    interceptedRequest.abort('failed', _config.abortPriority);\n  } else {\n    // Here we use a custom-configured priority to allow for Opinionated\n    // continuation.\n    // We would only want to allow this if we had a very clear reason why\n    // some use cases required Opinionated continuation.\n    interceptedRequest.continue(\n      interceptedRequest.continueRequestOverrides(),\n      _config.continuePriority, // Why would we ever want priority!==0 here?\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe above solutions ensure backward compatibility while also allowing the user\nto adjust the importance of your package in the resolution chain when\nCooperative Intercept Mode is being used. Your package continues to work as\nexpected until the user has fully upgraded their code and all third party\npackages to use Cooperative Intercept Mode. If any handler or package still uses\nLegacy Mode, your package can still operate in Legacy Mode too."
