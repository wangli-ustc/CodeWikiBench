Providers register themselves by adding an\ninstance of the provider to the `Application` object via the `RegisterProvider`\nmethod in [`Core.Program`][core-program].\nThe `GenericHostProvider` is registered last so that it can handle all other\nHTTP-based remotes as a catch-all, and provide basic username/password auth and\ndetect the presence of Windows Integrated Authentication (Kerberos, NTLM,\nNegotiate) support (1).\n\nFor each invocation of GCM, the first argument on the command-line is\nmatched against the known commands and if there is a successful match, the input\nfrom Git (over standard input) is deserialized and the command is executed (2).\n\nThe `Get|Store|EraseCommand`s consult the host provider registry for the most\nappropriate host provider. The default registry implementation select the a host\nprovider by asking each registered provider in turn if they understand the\nrequest. The provider selection can be overridden by the user via the\n[`credential.provider`][credential-provider] or [`GCM_PROVIDER`][gcm-provider]\nconfiguration and environment variable respectively (3).\n\nThe `Get|Store|EraseCommand`s call the corresponding\n`Get|Store|EraseCredentialAsync` methods on the `IHostProvider`, passing the\nrequest from Git together with an instance of the `ICommandContext` (4). The\nhost provider can then make use of various services available on the command\ncontext to complete the requested operation (5).\n\nOnce a credential has been created, retrieved, stored or erased, the host\nprovider returns the credential (for `get` operations only) to the calling\ncommand (6). The credential is then serialized and returned to Git over standard\noutput (7) and GCM terminates with a successful exit code.",
        "Host provider": "Host providers implement the `IHostProvider` interface. They can choose to\ndirectly implement the interface they can also derive from the `HostProvider`\nabstract class (which itself implements the `IHostProvider` interface).\n\nThe `HostProvider` abstract class implements the\n`Get|Store|EraseCredentialAsync` methods and instead has the\n`GenerateCredentialAsync` abstract method, and the `GetServiceName` virtual\nmethod. Calls to `get`, `store`, or `erase` result in first a call to\n`GetServiceName` which should return a stable and unique value for the provider\nand request. This value forms part of the attributes associated with any stored\ncredential in the credential store. During a `get` operation the\ncredential store is queried for an existing credential with such service name.\nIf a credential is found it is returned immediately. Similarly, calls to `store`\nand `erase` are handles automatically to store credentials against, and erase\ncredentials matching the service name. Methods are implemented as `virtual`\nmeaning you can always override this behaviour, for example to clear other\ncustom caches on an `erase` request, without having to reimplement the\nlookup/store credential logic.\n\nThe default implementation of `GetServiceName` is usually sufficient for most\nproviders. It returns the computed remote URL (without a trailing slash) from\nthe input arguments from Git - `<protocol>://<host>[/<path>]` - no username is\nincluded even if present.\n\nHost providers are queried in turn, by priority (then registration order) via\nthe `IHostProvider.IsSupported(InputArguments)` method and passed the input\nreceived from Git. If the provider recognises the request, for example by a\nmatching known host name, they can return `true`. If the provider wants to\ncancel and abort an authentication request, for example if this is a HTTP (not\nHTTPS) request for a known host, they should still return `true` and later\ncancel the request.\n\nHost providers can also be queried via the `IHostProvider.IsSupported(HttpResponseMessage)`\nmethod and passed the response message from a HEAD call made to the remote URI.\nThis is useful for detecting on-premises instances based on header values. GCM\nwill only query a provider via this method overload if no other provider at the\nsame registration priority has returned `true` to the `InputArguments` overload.\n\nDepending on the request from Git, one of `GetCredentialAsync` (for `get`\nrequests), `StoreCredentialAsync` (for `store` requests) or\n`EraseCredentialAsync` (for `erase` requests) will be called. The argument\n`InputArguments` contains the request information passed over standard input\nfrom Git/the caller; the same as was passed to `IsSupported`.\n\nThe return value for the `get` operation must be an `ICredential` that Git can\nuse to complete authentication.\n\n['**Note:**', 'The credential can also be an instance where both username and password are\\nthe empty string, to signal to Git it should let cURL use \"any auth\"\\ndetection - typically to use Windows Integrated Authentication.']\n\nThere are no return values for the `store` and `erase` operations as Git ignores\nany output or exit codes for these commands. Failures for these operations are\nbest communicated via writing to the Standard Error stream via\n`ICommandContext.Streams.Error`.",
        "Command context": "The `ICommandContext` which contains numerous services which are useful for\ninteracting with various platform subsystems, such as the file system or\nenvironment variables.

        "Error handling and tracing": "GCM operates a 'fail fast' approach to unrecoverable errors. This usually\nmeans throwing an `Exception` which will propagate up to the entry-point and be\ncaught, a non-zero exit code returned, and the error message printed with the\n\"fatal:\" prefix. For errors originating from interop/native code, you should\nthrow an exception of the `InteropException` type. Error messages in exceptions\nshould be human readable. When there is a known or user-fixable issue,\ninstructions on how to self-remedy the issue, or links to relevant\ndocumentation should be given.\n\nWarnings can be emitted over the standard error stream\n(`ICommandContext.Streams.Error`) when you want to alert the user to a potential\nissue with their configuration that does not necessarily stop the\noperation/authentication.\n\nThe `ITrace` component can be found on the `ICommandContext` object or passed in\ndirectly to some constructors.

This triggers a flow on Bitbucket requiring you to log in\n(and potentially complete 2FA) to authorize GCM to access Bitbucket with the\nspecified scopes. GCM will then spawn a temporary local webserver, listening on\nport 34106, to handle the OAuth redirect/callback. Assuming you successfully\nlog into Bitbucket and authorize GCM, this callback will include the appropriate\ntokens for GCM to handle authencation. These tokens are then stored in your\nconfigured [credential store][credstores] and are returned to Git.\n\nPassword/Token\n\n**Note:** Bitbucket Data Center, also known as Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket On\nPremises, only supports Basic Authentication - please follow the below\ninstructions if you are using this product.\n\nThe dialog GCM presents for authentication contains two tabs. The second tab\n(labeled `Password/Token`) will trigger Basic Authentication. This tab contains\ntwo fields, one for your username and one for your password or token. If the\n`username` parameter was passed into GCM, that will pre-populate the username\nfield, although it can be overridden. Enter your username (if needed) and your\npassword or token (i.e. Bitbucket App Password) and click `Sign in`.\n\n:rotating_light: Requirements for App Passwords :rotating_light:\n\nIf you are planning to use an [App Password][app-password] for basic\nauthentication, it must at a minimum have _Account Read_ permissions (as shown\nbelow). If your App Password does not have these permissions, you will be\nre-prompted for credentials on every interaction with the server.\n\n![][app-password-example]\n\nWhen your username and password are submitted, GCM will attempt to retrieve a\nbasic authentication token for these credentials via the Bitbucket REST API. If\nthis is successful, the credentials, username, and password/token are stored in\nyour configured [credential store][credstores] and are returned to Git.\n\nIf the API request fails with a 401 return code, the entered username/password\ncombination is invalid; nothing is stored and nothing is returned to Git. In\nthis scenario, re-attempt authentication, ensuring your credentials are correct.\n\nIf the API request fails with a 403 (Forbidden) return code, the username and\npassword are valid, but 2FA is enabled on the corresponding Bitbucket Account.\nIn this scenario, you will be prompted to complete the OAuth authentication\nprocess.  If this is successful, the credentials, username, and password/token\nare stored in your configured [credential store][credstores] and are returned to\nGit.\n\n[app-password]: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/\n[app-password-example]: img/app-password.png\n[credstores]: ./credstores.md"

          "Q: How does this project relate to [Git Credential Manager for Windows][gcm-windows] and [Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux][gcm-linux]?": "Git Credential Manager for Windows (GCM Windows) is a .NET Framework-based Git\ncredential helper which runs on Windows. Likewise the Git Credential Manager for\nMac and Linux (Java GCM) is a Java-based Git credential helper that runs only on\nmacOS and Linux. Although both of these projects aim to solve the same problem\n(providing seamless multi-factor HTTPS authentication with Git), they are based\non different codebases and languages which is becoming hard to manage to ensure\nfeature parity.\n\nGit Credential Manager (GCM; this project) aims to replace both GCM Windows and\nJava GCM with a unified codebase which should be easier to maintain and enhance\nin the future.",
          "Q: Does this mean GCM for Windows (.NET Framework-based) is deprecated?": "Yes. Git Credential Manager for Windows (GCM Windows) is no longer receiving\nupdates and fixes. All development effort has now been directed to GCM. GCM is\navailable as an credential helper option in Git for Windows 2.28, and will be\nmade the default helper in 2.29.",
          "Q: Does this mean the Java-based GCM for Mac/Linux is deprecated?": "Yes. Usage of Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux (Java GCM) should be\nreplaced with GCM or SSH keys. If you wish to install GCM on macOS or Linux,\nplease follow the [download and installation instructions][download-and-install].",
          "Q: I want to use SSH": "GCM is only useful for HTTP(S)-based remotes. Git supports SSH out-of-the box so\nyou shouldn't need to install anything else.\n\nTo use SSH please follow the below links:\n\n['[Azure DevOps][azure-ssh]', '[GitHub][github-ssh]', '[Bitbucket][bitbucket-ssh]']",

          "Q: Why does GCM not support operating system/distribution 'X', or Git hosting provider 'Y'?": "The likely answer is we haven't gotten around to that yet! 🙂\n\nWe are working on ensuring support for the Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu operating\nsystem, as well as the following Git hosting providers: Azure Repos, Azure\nDevOps Server (TFS), GitHub, and Bitbucket.\n\nWe are happy to accept proposals and/or contributions to enable GCM to run on\nother platforms and Git host providers. Thank you!"

        "Technical": {
          "Why is the `credential.useHttpPath` setting required for `dev.azure.com`?": "Due to the design of Git and credential helpers such as GCM, we need this\nsetting to make Git use the full remote URL (including the path component) when\ncommunicating with GCM. The new `dev.azure.com` format of Azure DevOps URLs\nmeans the account name is now part of the path component (for example:\n`https://dev.azure.com/contoso/...`). The Azure DevOps account name is required\nin order to resolve the correct authority for authentication (which Azure AD\ntenant backs this account, or if it is backed by Microsoft personal accounts).\n\nIn the older GCM for Windows product, the solution to the same problem was a\n\"hack\". GCM for Windows would walk the process tree looking for the\n`git-remote-https.exe` process, and attempt to read/parse the process\nenvironment block looking for the command line arguments (that contained the\nfull remote URL). This is fragile and not a cross-platform solution, hence the\nneed for the `credential.useHttpPath` setting with GCM.",
          "Why does GCM take so long at startup the first time?": "GCM will [autodetect][autodetect] what kind of Git host it's talking to. GitHub,\nBitbucket, and Azure DevOps each have their own form(s) of authentication, plus\nthere's a \"generic\" username and password option.\n\nFor the hosted versions of these services, GCM can guess from the URL which\nservice to use. But for on-premises versions which would have unique URLs, GCM\nwill probe with a network call. GCM caches the results of the probe, so it\nshould be faster on the second and later invocations.\n\nIf you know which provider you're talking to and want to avoid the probe, that's\npossible. You can explicitly tell GCM which provider to use for a URL\n\"example.com\" like this:\n\nProvider|Command\n-|-\nGitHub|`git config --global credential.https://example.com.provider github`\nBitbucket|`git config --global credential.https://example.com.provider bitbucket`\nAzure DevOps|`git config --global credential.https://example.com.provider azure-repos`\nGeneric|`git config --global credential.https://example.com.provider generic`",
          "How do I fix \"Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel\" errors on Windows 7?": "This likely indicates that you don't have newer TLS versions available. Please\n[follow Microsoft's guide][enable-windows-ssh] for enabling TLS 1.1 and 1.2 on\nyour machine, specifically the **SChannel** instructions. You'll need to be on\nat least Windows 7 SP1, and in the end you should have a `TLS 1.2` key with\n`DisabledByDefault` set to `0`. You can also read\n[more from Microsoft][windows-server-tls] on this change.",
          "How do I use GCM with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)?": "Follow the instructions in [our WSL guide][wsl] carefully. Especially note the\nneed to run `git config --global credential.https://dev.azure.com.useHttpPath true`\n_within_ WSL if you're using Azure DevOps.",
          "Does GCM work with multiple users? If so, how?": "That's a fairly complicated question to answer, but in short, yes. See\n[our document on multiple users][multiple-users] for details.",
          "How can I disable GUI dialogs and prompts?": "There are various environment variables and configuration options available to\ncustomize how GCM will prompt you (or not) for input.

          "How can I extend GUI prompts/integrate prompts with my application?": "Application developers who use Git - think Visual Studio, GitKraken, etc. - may\nwant to replace the GCM default UI with prompts styled to look like their\napplication. This isn't complicated (though it is a bit of work).\n\nYou can replace the GUI prompts of the Bitbucket and GitHub host providers\nspecifically by using the `credential.gitHubHelper`/`credential.bitbucketHelper`\nsettings or `GCM_GITHUB_HELPER`/`GCM_BITBUCKET_HELPER` environment variables.\n\nSet these variables to the path of an external helper executable that responds\nto the requests as the bundled UI helpers do. See the current `--help` documents\nfor the bundled UI helpers (`GitHub.UI`/`Atlassian.Bitbucket.UI`) for more\ninformation.\n\nYou may also set these variables to the empty string `\"\"` to force terminal/\ntext-based prompts instead.",

          "How do I revoke access for a GitLab OAuth application?": "There are some scenarios (e.g. updated scopes) for which you will need to\nmanually revoke and re-authorize access for a GitLab OAuth application. You can\ndo so by:\n\n['Navigating to [the **Applications** page within your **User Settings**][gitlab-apps].', 'Scrolling to **Authorized applications**.', 'Clicking the **Revoke** button next to the name of the application for which\\nyou would like to revoke access (Git Credential Manager is used here for\\ndemonstration purposes).', '![Button to revoke GitLab OAuth Application access][gitlab-oauthapp-revoke]', 'Waiting for a notification stating **The application was revoked access**.', '![Notifaction of successful revocation][gitlab-oauthapp-revoked]', 'Re-authorizing the application with the new scope (GCM should automatically\\ninitiate this flow for you next time access is requested).']",
          "Q: What do the `configure` and `unconfigure` commands do?": {
            "`configure`": "The `configure` command will set up Git to use GCM exclusively as the credential\nhelper. The `configure` command is automatically called by the installers for\nWindows and macOS, but you can also run it manually.\n\nIt will also set Git to provide the full remote URL (including path) to\ncredential helpers for Azure Repos remotes using the `dev.azure.com` URL format.\nThis is required in order to be to able to correctly identify the correct\nauthority for that Azure DevOps organization.\n\nSpecifically, the `configure` command will modify your user Git configuration to\ninclude the following lines:\n\n```\n[credential]\n    helper =\n    helper = <path-to-gcm>\n[credential \"https://dev.azure.com\"]\n    useHttpPath = true\n```\n\n..where `<path-to-gcm>` is the absolute path to the GCM executable.\n\nThe empty `helper =` line makes sure that existing credential helpers that may\nbe set in the system Git configuration are not used. For more details see the\n[credential.helper][helper-config-docs].\n\nIf you pass the `--system` option, the `configure` command will instead modify\nthe system Git configuration. This is useful if you want to set up GCM for all\nusers on a machine.",

Rejecting Requests": "The `IsSupported` methods MUST return `true` if the host provider would like to\ncancel the authentication operation based on the current context or input.\nFor example, if provider requires a secure protocol but the requested protocol\nfor a supported hostname is `http` and not `https`.\n\nHost providers MUST instead cancel the request from the `GetCredentialAsync`\nmethod by throwing an `Exception`. Implementors MUST provide detailed\ninformation regarding the reason why the authentication cannot continue, for\nexample \"HTTP is not secure, please use HTTPS\"."

A host provider SHOULD attempt to detect the best authentication\nexperience given the current environment or context, and select that one to\nattempt first.\n\nHost providers are RECOMMENDED to attempt authentication mechanisms that do not\nrequire user interaction if possible. If there are multiple authentication\nmechanisms that could be equally considered \"best\" they MAY prompt the user\nto make a selection. Host providers MAY wish to remember such a selection for\nfuture use, however they MUST make it clear how to clear this stored selection\nto the user.\n\nIf interaction is required to complete authentication a host provider MUST first\ncheck if interaction has been disabled (`ISettings.IsInteractionAllowed`), and\nan exception MUST be thrown if interaction has been disallowed.\n\nAuthentication prompts that display a graphical user interface such as a window\nare MUST be preferred when an interactive \"desktop\" session is available.\n\nIf an authentication prompt is required when an interactive session is not\navailable and a terminal/TTY is attached then a provider MUST first check if\nterminal prompts are enabled (`ISettings.IsTerminalPromptsEnabled`), and an\nexception MUST be thrown if interaction has been disallowed."

          "2.4. Storing Credentials": "Host providers MAY store credentials at various stages of a typical\nauthentication flow, or when explicitly requested to do so in a call to\n`StoreCredentialAsync`.\n\nProviders SHOULD use the credential store (exposed as `ICredentialStore`) to\npersist secret values and credential entities such as passwords, PATs and OAuth\ntokens.\n\nThe typical Git credential helper call pattern is one call to `get`, followed by\neither a `store` request in case of a HTTP 200 (OK) response, or `erase` in case\nof HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) response. In some cases there is additional context\nthat is present as part of the `get` request or during the generation of a new\ncredential that is not present during the subsequent call to `store` (or\n`erase`). In these cases providers MAY store the credential during the `get`\nrather than, or as well as during the `store`.\n\nHost providers MAY store multiple credentials or tokens in the same request if\nit is required. One example where multiple credential storage is needed is with\nOAuth2 access tokens (AT) and refresh tokens (RT). Both the AT and RT SHOULD be\nstored in the same location using the credential store with complementary\ncredential service names.",
          "2.5. Erasing Credentials": "If host providers have stored credentials in the credential store, they MUST\nrespond to requests to erase them in calls to `EraseCredentialAsync`.\n\nIf a host provider cannot locate a credential to erase it MUST NOT raise an\nerror and MUST exit successfully. A warning message MAY be emitted to the\ntracing system.\n\nHost providers MUST NOT perform their own repeated validation of credentials\nfor the purposes of ignoring the request to erase them. The ultimate authority\non the validity of a credential is the caller (Git).\n\nProviders MAY validate any additional or ancillary credentials (such as OAuth\nRTs) are still valid when a request to erase the primary credential (such as an\nOAuth AT) is made, and choose not to delete those additional credentials. The\nprimary credential MUST still always be erased in all cases.",

The value returned MUST be stable - i.e, it MUST return the same\nvalue given the same or equivalent input arguments.\n\nBy default this method returns the full remote URI, without a trailing slash,\nincluding protocol/scheme, hostname, and path if present in the input arguments.\nAny username in the input arguments is never included in the URI.",
            "2.6.2 `GenerateCredentialAsync`": "The `GenerateCredentialAsync` method will be called if an existing credential\nwith a matching service (from `GetServiceName`) and account is not found in the\ncredential store.\n\nThis method MUST return a freshly created/generated credential and not any\nexisting or stored one. It MAY use existing or stored ancillary data or tokens,\nsuch as OAuth refresh tokens, to generate the new token (such as an OAuth AT)."
          },
          "2.7. External Metadata": "Host providers MAY wish to store extra data about authentications or users\ncollected or produced during authentication operations. These SHOULD be stored\nin a per-user, local location such as the user's home or profile directory.\n\nSecrets, credentials or other sensitive data SHOULD be stored in the credential\nstore, or otherwise protected by some form of per-user, local encryption.\n\nIn the case of stored data caches, providers SHOULD invalidate relevant parts\nof, or the entire cache, when a call to `EraseCredentialAsync` is made."

If the reason\nfor failure can be fixed by the user the error message MUST include instructions\nto fix the problem, or a link to online documentation.\n\nIn the case of a recoverable error, host providers SHOULD print a warning\nmessage to the standard error stream, and MUST include the error information and\nthe recovery steps take in the trace log.\n\nIn the case of an authentication error, providers SHOULD attempt to prompt the\nuser again with a message indicating the incorrect authentication details have\nbeen entered.",
        "5. Custom Commands": "If a host provider wishes to surface custom commands the SHOULD implement the\n`ICommandProvider` interface.\n\nEach provider is given the opportunity to create a single `ProviderCommand`\ninstance to which further sub-commands can be parented to. Commanding is\nprovided by the `System.CommandLine` API library [[1][references]].\n\nThere are no limitations on what format sub-commands, arguments, or options must\ntake, but implementors SHOULD attempt to follow existing practices and styles.",

This is\nbecause GCM is running as a Windows application, and therefore will use the Git\nfor Windows installation to query configuration.\n\nThis means things like proxy settings for GCM need to be set in Git for Windows\nas well as WSL Git as they are stored in different files\n(`%USERPROFILE%\\.gitconfig` vs `\\\\wsl$\\distro\\home\\$USER\\.gitconfig`).\n\nYou can configure WSL such that GCM will use the WSL Git configuration following\nthe [instructions above][configuring-wsl-without-git-for-windows]. However,\nthis then means that things like proxy settings are unique to the specific WSL\ninstallation, and not shared with others or the Windows host.",
        "Can I install Git Credential Manager directly inside of WSL?": "Yes. Rather than install GCM as a Windows application (and have WSL Git invoke\nthe Windows GCM), can you install GCM as a Linux application instead.\n\nTo do this, simply follow the\n[GCM installation instructions for Linux][linux-installation].\n\n**Note:** In this scenario, because GCM is running as a Linux application\nit cannot utilize authentication or credential storage features of the host\nWindows operating system.\n\n[wsl]: https://aka.ms/wsl\n[configuring-wsl-without-git-for-windows]: #configuring-wsl-without-git-for-windows\n[latest-git-for-windows]: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest\n[latest-gcm]: https://aka.ms/gcm/latest\n[wsl-interop]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/interop\n[linux-installation]: ../README.md#linux"
