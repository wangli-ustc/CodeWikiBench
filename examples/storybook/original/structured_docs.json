      "content": {
        "Error: No angular.json file found": "Storybook can be set up for both single-project and multi-project Angular workspaces. To set up Storybook for a project, run [the install command](./get-started/install) at the root of the workspace where the `angular.json` file is located. During initialization, the `.storybook` folder will be created and the `angular.json` file will be edited to add the Storybook configuration for the selected project. It's important to run the command at the root level to ensure that Storybook detects all projects correctly.",
        "How can I opt-out of Angular Ivy?": "In case you are having trouble with Angular Ivy you can deactivate it in your `main.js|ts`:\n\n```\nexport default {\n  stories: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n  addons: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n  framework: {\n    name: '@storybook/angular',\n    options: {\n      enableIvy: false,\n    },\n  },\n};\n```",
        "How can I opt-out of Angular ngcc?": "In case you postinstall ngcc, you can disable it:\n\n```\nexport default {\n  stories: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n  addons: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n  framework: {\n    name: '@storybook/angular',\n    options: {\n      enableNgcc: false,\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nPlease report any issues related to Ivy in our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/labels/app%3A%20angular) as the support for View Engine will be dropped in a future release of Angular.",
        "How can I run coverage tests with Create React App and leave out stories?": "Create React App does not allow providing options to Jest in your `package.json`, however you can run `jest` with commandline arguments:\n\n```\nnpm test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='[\"src/**/*.{js,jsx}\",\"!src/**/stories/*\"]'\n```\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"💡\">\n\nIf you're using [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager, you'll need to adjust the command accordingly.\n\n</Callout>",
        "How do I setup Storybook to share Webpack configuration with Next.js?": "You can generally reuse Webpack rules by placing them in a file that is imported from both your `next.config.js` and your `.storybook/main.js|ts` files. For example:\n\n```\nexport default {\n  webpackFinal: async (baseConfig) => {\n    const nextConfig = await import('/path/to/next.config.js');\n\n    // merge whatever from nextConfig into the webpack config storybook will use\n    return { ...baseConfig, ...nextConfig };\n  },\n};\n```",
        "How do I fix module resolution in special environments?": "In case you are using [Yarn Plug-n-Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) or your project is set up within a mono repository environment, you might run into issues with module resolution similar to this when running Storybook:\n\n```\nWARN   Failed to load preset: \"@storybook/react-webpack5/preset\"\nRequired package: @storybook/react-webpack5 (via \"@storybook/react-webpack5/preset\")\n```\n\nTo fix this, you can wrap the package name inside your Storybook configuration file (i.e., `.storybook/main.js|ts`) as follows:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-main-pnpm-with-module-resolution.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",
        "How do I setup the new React Context Root API with Storybook?": "If your installed React Version equals or is higher than 18.0.0, the new React Root API is automatically used and the newest React [concurrent features](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html) can be used.\n\nYou can opt-out from the new React Root API by setting the following property in your `.storybook/main.js|ts` file:\n\n```\nexport default {\n  framework: {\n    name: '@storybook/react-webpack5',\n    options: {\n      legacyRootApi: true,\n    },\n  },\n};\n```",
        "Why is there no addons channel?": "A common error is that an addon tries to access the \"channel\", but the channel is not set. It can happen in a few different cases:\n\n[\"You're trying to access addon channel (e.g., by calling `setOptions`) in a non-browser environment like Jest. You may need to add a channel mock:\", \"```\\nimport { addons, mockChannel } from 'storybook/preview-api';\\n\\naddons.setChannel(mockChannel());\\n```\", \"In React Native, it's a special case documented in [#1192](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/1192)\"]",
        "Why aren't the addons working in a composed Storybook?": "Composition is a new feature that we released with version 6.0, and there are still some limitations to it.\n\nFor now, the addons you're using in a composed Storybook will not work.\n\nWe're working on overcoming this limitation, and soon you'll be able to use them as if you are working with a non-composed Storybook.",
        "Can I have a Storybook with no local stories?": "Storybook does not work unless you have at least one local story (or docs page) defined in your project. In this context, local means a `.stories.*` or `.mdx` file that is referenced in your project's `.storybook/main.js` config.\n\nIf you're in a [Storybook composition](./sharing/storybook-composition.mdx) scenario, where you have multiple Storybooks, and want to have an extra Storybook with no stories of its own, that serves as a \"glue\" for all the other Storybooks in a project for demo/documentation purposes, you can do the following steps:\n\nIntroduce a single `.mdx` docs page (addon-docs required), that serves as an Introduction page, like so:\n\n```\n# Welcome\n\nSome description here\n```\n\nAnd then refer to it in your Storybook config file:\n\n```\nconst config = {\n  // define at least one local story/page here\n  stories: ['../Introduction.mdx'],\n  // define composed Storybooks here\n  refs: {\n    firstProject: { title: 'First', url: 'some-url' },\n    secondProject: { title: 'Second', url: 'other-url' },\n  },\n  // ...\n};\nexport default config;\n```",
        "Which community addons are compatible with the latest version of Storybook?": "Starting with Storybook version 6.0, we've introduced some great features aimed at streamlining your development workflow.\n\nWith this, we would like to point out that if you plan on using addons created by our fantastic community, you need to consider that some of those addons might be working with an outdated version of Storybook.\n\nWe're actively working to provide a better way to address this situation, but in the meantime, we'd like to ask for a bit of caution on your end so that you don't run into unexpected problems. Let us know by leaving a comment in the following [GitHub issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/26031) so that we can gather information and expand the current list of addons that need to be updated to work with the latest version of Storybook.",
        "Is it possible to browse the documentation for past versions of Storybook?": "With the release of version 6.0, we updated our documentation as well. That doesn't mean that the old documentation was removed. We kept it to help you with your Storybook migration process. Use the content from the table below in conjunction with our [migration guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md).\n\nWe're only covering versions 5.3 and 5.0 as they were important milestones for Storybook.

However, if you need, you can still access the old `storiesOf` [documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/release/5.3/docs/src/pages/formats/storiesof-api/index.md) for reference.\n</Callout>",
        "What icons are available for my toolbar or my addon?": "With the [`@storybook/icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/icons) package, you get a set of icons that you can use to customize your UI. Go through the [documentation](https://main--64b56e737c0aeefed9d5e675.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/introduction--docs) to see how the icons look and use it as a reference when writing your addon or defining your Storybook global types.",
        "I see a \"No Preview\" error with a Storybook production build": "If you're using the `serve` package to verify your production build of Storybook, you'll get that error. It relates to how `serve` handles rewrites. For instance, `/iframe.html` is rewritten into `/iframe`, and you'll get that error.\n\nWe recommend that you use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) instead and use the following command to preview Storybook:\n\n```\nnpx http-server storybook-static\n```\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\">\nSuppose you don't want to run the command above frequently.

        "Can I use Storybook with Vue 2?": "Vue 2 entered [End of Life](https://v2.vuejs.org/lts/) (EOL) on December 31, 2023, and is no longer supported by the Vue team. As a result, we've stopped supporting Vue 2 in Storybook 8 and above and will not be releasing any new versions that support it. We recommend upgrading your project to Vue 3, which Storybook fully supports. If that's not an option, you can still use Storybook with Vue 2 by installing the latest version of Storybook 7 with the following command:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-init-v7.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",
        "Why aren't my code blocks highlighted with Storybook MDX?": "Out of the box, Storybook provides syntax highlighting for a set of languages (e.g., Javascript, Markdown, CSS, HTML, Typescript, GraphQL) you can use with your code blocks. Currently, there's a known limitation when you try to register a custom language to get syntax highlighting. We're working on a fix for this and will update this section once it's available.",
        "Why aren't my MDX styles working in Storybook?": "Writing documentation with MDX can be troublesome, especially regarding how your code is formatted when using line breaks with code blocks. For example, this will break:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n```\n<style>{`\n  .class1 {\n    ...\n  }\n\n  .class2 {\n    ...\n  }\n`}</style>\n```\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nBut this will work:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n```\n<style>\n  {`\n    .class1 {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    .class2 {\n      ...\n    }\n  `}\n</style>\n```\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nSee the following [issue](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/1945) for more information.",
        "Why are my mocked GraphQL queries failing with Storybook's MSW addon?": "If you're working with Vue 3, you'll need to install [`@vue/apollo-composable`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/apollo-composable). With Svelte, you'll need to install [`@rollup/plugin-replace`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-replace) and update your `rollup.config` file to the following:\n\n```\n// Boilerplate imports\n\nimport replace from '@rollup/plugin-replace';\nconst production = !process.env.ROLLUP_WATCH;\n\n// Remainder rollup.config implementation\n\nexport default {\n  input: 'src/main.js',\n  output: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    format: 'iife',\n    name: 'app',\n    file: 'public/build/bundle.js',\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    // Other plugins\n\n    // Configures the replace plugin to allow GraphQL Queries to work properly\n    replace({\n      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('development'),\n    }),\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nWith Angular, the most common issue is the placement of the `mockServiceWorker.js` file. Use this [example](https://github.com/mswjs/examples/tree/main/examples/with-angular) as a point of reference.",
        "Can I use other GraphQL providers with Storybook's MSW addon?": "Yes, check the [addon's examples](https://github.com/mswjs/msw-storybook-addon/tree/main/packages/docs/src/demos) to learn how to integrate different providers.",
        "Can I mock GraphQL mutations with Storybook's MSW addon?": "No, currently, the MSW addon only has support for GraphQL queries. If you're interested in including this feature, open an issue in the [MSW addon repository](https://github.com/mswjs/msw-storybook-addon) and follow up with the maintainer.",
        "Why are my stories not showing up correctly when using certain characters?": "Storybook allows you to use most characters while naming your stories. Still, specific characters (e.g., `#`) can lead to issues when Storybook generates the internal identifier for the story, leading to collisions and incorrectly outputting the correct story. We recommend using such characters sparsely.",
        "Why is Storybook's source loader returning undefined with curried functions?": "This is a known issue with Storybook. If you're interested in getting it fixed, open an issue with a [working reproduction](./contribute/how-to-reproduce.mdx) so that it can be triaged and fixed in future releases.",
        "Why are my args no longer displaying the default values?": "Before version 6.3, unset args were set to the `argTypes.defaultValue` if specified or inferred from the component's properties (e.g., React's prop types, Angular inputs, Vue props). Starting with version 6.3, Storybook no longer infers default values but instead defines the arg's value as `undefined` when unset, allowing the framework to supply its default value.\n\nIf you are using `argTypes.defaultValue` to fix the above, you no longer need to, and you can safely remove it from your stories.\n\nAdditionally, suppose you were using `argTypes.defaultValue` or relying on inference to set a default value for an arg. In that case, you should define the arg's value at the component level instead:\n\n```\nexport default {\n  component: MyComponent,\n  args: {\n    //👇 Defining the arg's value at the component level.\n    text: 'Something',\n  },\n};\n```\n\nFor Storybook's Docs, you can manually configure the displayed value by configuring the `table.defaultValue` setting:\n\n```\nexport default {\n  component: MyComponent,\n  argTypes: {\n    //👇 Defining the arg's display value in docs.\n    text: {\n      table: { defaultValue: { summary: 'SomeType<T>' } },\n    },\n  },\n};\n```",
        "Why isn't Storybook's test runner working?": "There's an issue with Storybook's test runner and the latest version of Jest (i.e., version 28), which prevents it from running effectively. As a workaround, you can downgrade Jest to the previous stable version (i.e., version 27), and you'll be able to run it. See the following [issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/test-runner/issues/99) for more information.",
        "How does Storybook handle environment variables?": "Storybook has built-in support for [environment variables](./configure/environment-variables.mdx). By default, environment variables are only available in Node.js code and are not available in the browser as some variables should be kept secret (e.g., API keys) and **not** exposed to anyone visiting the published Storybook.\n\nTo expose a variable, you must preface its name with `STORYBOOK_`. So `STORYBOOK_API_URL` will be available in browser code but `API_KEY` will not. Additionally you can also customize which variables are exposed by setting the [`env`](./configure/environment-variables.mdx#using-storybook-configuration) field in the `.storybook/main.js` file.\n\nVariables are set when JavaScript is compiled so when the development server is started or you build your Storybook. Environment variable files should not be committed to Git as they often contain secrets which are not safe to add to Git. Instead, add `.env.*` to your `.gitignore` file and set up the environment variables manually on your hosting provider (e.g., [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository))."

This means you no longer need to reference individual Storybook packages as dependencies. Instead, define `storybook` as a peer dependency in your addon's `package.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-storybook-addon\",\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"storybook\": \"^9.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"storybook\": \">=9.0.0-0 <10.0.0-0\" // For local development\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that:\n\n['Your addon uses the same version of Storybook APIs as the host project', 'You avoid duplicate Storybook packages in the final bundle', \"Your addon's package size is minimized\"]\n\nIf your addon supports multiple major versions of Storybook, you can specify a wider version range in your peer dependencies:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-storybook-addon\",\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"storybook\": \"^8.0.0 || ^9.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"storybook\": \">=9.0.0-0 <10.0.0-0\" // For local development\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, we recommend releasing a new major version of your addon alongside new major versions of Storybook.

Out of the box, the Addon Kit comes with a pre-configured `tsup` configuration file that you can use to customize the build process of your addon.\n\nWhen the build scripts run, it will look for the configuration file and pre-bundle the addon's code based on the configuration provided. Addons can interact with Storybook in various ways. They can define presets to modify the configuration, add behavior to the manager UI, or add behavior to the preview iframe. These different use cases require different bundle outputs because they target different runtimes and environments. Presets are executed in a Node environment. Storybook's manager and preview environments provide certain packages in the global scope, so addons don't need to bundle them or include them as dependencies in their `package.json` file.\n\nThe `tsup` configuration handles these complexities by default, but you can customize it according to their requirements. For a detailed explanation of the bundling techniques used, please refer to [the README of the addon-kit](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-kit#bundling), and check out the default `tsup` configuration [here](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-kit/blob/main/tsup.config.ts)."

Therefore, we'll need to make some changes to our addon to allow it to use the styles when it is active and remove them when it's disabled. We're going to rely on two of Storybook's features to handle this: [decorators](../writing-stories/decorators.mdx) and [globals](../essentials/toolbars-and-globals.mdx#globals). To handle the CSS logic, we must include some helper functions to inject and remove the stylesheets from the DOM. Start by creating the helper file with the following content:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-addon-css-helpers.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nNext, create the file with the styles we want to inject with the following content:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-addon-css-example.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nSince the addon can be active in both the story and documentation modes, the DOM node for Storybook's preview `iframe` is different in these two modes. In fact, Storybook renders multiple story previews on one page when in documentation mode. Therefore, we'll need to choose the correct selector for the DOM node where the styles will be injected and ensure the CSS is scoped to that particular selector. That mechanism is provided as an example within the `src/withGlobals.ts` file, which we'll use to connect the styling and helper functions to the addon logic. Update the file to the following:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-addon-use-global.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}"

For example:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-custom-manager-head.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nHowever, if you need, you can also customize the template used by Storybook to render the UI.

            "Scaffolding a new framework": "The first thing to do is to scaffold your framework support in its own repo.\n\nWe recommend adopting the same project structure as the Storybook monorepo. That structure contains the framework package (`app/<framework>`) and an example app (`examples/<framework>-kitchen-sink`) as well as other associated documentation and configuration as needed.\n\nIt may seem like a little more hierarchy than what’s necessary. But because the structure mirrors the way Storybook’s monorepo is structured, you can reuse Storybook’s tooling. It also makes it easier to move the framework into the Storybook monorepo later if that is desirable.\n\nWe recommend using `@storybook/html` as a starter framework since it’s the simplest and contains no framework-specific peculiarities. There is a boilerplate to get you started [here](https://github.com/CodeByAlex/storybook-framework-boilerplate).",
            "Framework architecture": "Supporting a new framework in Storybook typically consists of two main aspects:\n\n['Configuring the server. In Storybook, the server is the node process that runs when you run `storybook dev` or `storybook build`. Configuring the server typically means configuring babel and webpack in framework-specific ways.', 'Configuring the client. The client is the code that runs in the browser, and configuring it, means providing a framework-specific story rendering function.']",
            "Configuring the server": {
              "Package structure": "It's helpful to understand Storybook's package structure before adding a framework preset. Each framework typically exposes two executables in its `package.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"storybook\": \"./bin/index.js\",\n    \"build-storybook\": \"./bin/build.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese scripts pass an `options` object to `storybook/internal/server`, a library that abstracts all of Storybook’s framework-independent code.\n\nFor example, here’s the boilerplate to start the dev server with `storybook dev`:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-start-dev-server.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nThus the essence of adding framework presets is just filling in that options object.",
              "Server options": "As described above, the server `options` object does the heavy lifting of configuring the server.\n\nLet’s look at the `@storybook/vue`’s options definition:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-server-options.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nThe value of the `framework` option (i.e., ‘vue’) is something that gets passed to addons and allows them to do specific tasks related to your framework.\n\nThe essence of this file is the framework presets, and these are standard [Storybook presets](../addons/writing-presets.mdx) -- you can look at framework packages in the Storybook monorepo (e.g. [React](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/main/app/react/src/server/options.ts), [Vue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/main/app/vue/src/server/options.ts), [Web Components](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/main/app/web-components/src/server/options.ts)) to see examples of framework-specific customizations.\n\nWhile developing your custom framework, not maintained by Storybook, you can specify the path to the location file with the `frameworkPath` key:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-server-framework-options.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nYou can add a relative path to `frameworkPath`. Don't forget that they resolve from the Storybook configuration directory (i.e., `.storybook`) by default.\n\nMake sure the `frameworkPath` ends up at the `dist/client/index.js` file within your framework app."

It will change the name of the story and also change the story's ID and URL.\n\nIt would be best if you used the `name` configuration element in the following cases:\n\n['You want the name to show up in the Storybook UI in a way that\\'s not possible with a named export, e.g., reserved keywords like \"default\", special characters like emoji, spacing/capitalization other than what\\'s provided by `storyNameFromExport`.', \"You want to preserve the Story ID independently from changing how it's displayed.

See [Writing descriptions](#writing-descriptions) for more details."
                },
                "Writing descriptions": "There are multiple places to write the description of a component/story, depending on what you want to achieve. Descriptions can be written at the story level to describe each story of a component, or they can be written at the meta or component level to describe the component in general.\n\nDescriptions can be written as [JSDoc comments](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html) above stories, meta, or components. Alternatively they can also be specified in [`parameters`](../../writing-stories/parameters.mdx). To describe a story via parameters instead of comments, add it to `parameters.docs.description.story`; to describe meta/component, add it to `parameters.docs.description.component`.\n\nWe recommend using JSDoc comments for descriptions, and only use the `parameters.docs.description.X` properties in situations where comments are not possible to write for some reason, or where you want the description shown in Storybook to be different from the comments. Comments provide a better writing experience as you don’t have to worry about indentation, and they are more discoverable for other developers that are exploring the story/component sources.\n\nWhen documenting a story, reference a story export in the `of` prop (see below) and the Description block will look for descriptions in the following order:\n\n['`parameters.docs.description.story` in the story', 'JSDoc comments above the story']\n\nWhen documenting a component, reference a meta export in the `of` prop (see below) and the Description block will look for descriptions in the following order:\n\n['`parameters.docs.description.component` in the meta', 'JSDoc comments above the meta', 'JSDoc comments above the component']\n\nThis flow gives you powerful ways to override the description for each scenario. Take the following example:\n\n```\n/**\n * The Button component shows a button\n */\nexport const Button = () => <button>Click me</button>;\n```\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"api-doc-block-description-example.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n```\nimport { Meta, Description } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';\nimport * as ButtonStories from './Button.stories';\n\n<Meta of={ButtonStories} />\n\n{/* Shows the description for the default export (the meta).\n    If that didn't have any comments, it would show the \n    comments from the component instead */}\n<Description of={ButtonStories} />\n\n{/* Shows the description for the Primary export */}\n<Description of={ButtonStories.Primary} />\n```\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}"

To learn more, see the following [proof of concept](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-h2rgfk?file=README.md) to set up a custom indexer to generate stories dynamically. It contains everything needed to support such a feature, including the indexer, a Vite plugin, and a Webpack loader.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Defining stories in non-JavaScript language</summary>\n\nCustom indexers can be used for an advanced purpose: defining stories in any language, including template languages, and converting the files to CSF. To see examples of this in action, you can refer to [`@storybook/addon-svelte-csf`](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-svelte-csf) for Svelte template syntax and [`storybook-vue-addon`](https://github.com/tobiasdiez/storybook-vue-addon) for Vue template syntax.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Adding sidebar links from a URL collection</summary>\n\nThe indexer API is flexible enough to let you process arbitrary content, so long as your framework tooling can transform the exports in that content into actual stories it can run. This advanced example demonstrates how you can create a custom indexer to process a collection of URLs, extract the title and URL from each page, and render them as sidebar links in the UI. Implemented with Svelte, it can be adapted to any framework.\n\nStart by creating the URL collection file (i.e., `src/MyLinks.url.js`) with a list of URLs listed as named exports. The indexer will use the export name as the story title and the value as the unique identifier.\n\n```\nexport default {};\n\nexport const DesignTokens = 'https://www.designtokens.org/';\nexport const CobaltUI = 'https://cobalt-ui.pages.dev/';\nexport const MiseEnMode = 'https://mode.place/';\nexport const IndexerAPI = 'https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/23176';\n```\n\nAdjust your Vite configuration file to include a custom plugin complementing the indexer. This will allow Storybook to process and import the URL collection file as stories.\n\n```\nimport * as acorn from 'acorn';\nimport * as walk from 'acorn-walk';\nimport { defineConfig, type Plugin } from 'vite';\nimport { svelte } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';\n\nfunction StorybookUrlLinksPlugin(): Plugin {\n  return {\n    name: 'storybook-url-links',\n    async transform(code: string, id: string) {\n      if (id.endsWith('.url.js')) {\n        const ast = acorn.parse(code, {\n          ecmaVersion: 2020,\n          sourceType: 'module',\n        });\n\n        const namedExports: string[] = [];\n        let defaultExport = 'export default {};';\n\n        walk.simple(ast, {\n          // Extracts the named exports, those represent our stories, and for each of them, we'll return a valid Svelte component.\n          ExportNamedDeclaration(node: acorn.ExportNamedDeclaration) {\n            if (\n              node.declaration &&\n              node.declaration.type === 'VariableDeclaration'\n            ) {\n              node.declaration.declarations.forEach((declaration) => {\n                if ('name' in declaration.id) {\n                  namedExports.push(declaration.id.name);\n                }\n              });\n            }\n          },\n          // Preserve our default export.\n          ExportDefaultDeclaration(node: acorn.ExportDefaultDeclaration) {\n            defaultExport = code.slice(node.start, node.end);\n          },\n        });\n\n        return {\n          code: `\n            import RedirectBack from '../../.storybook/components/RedirectBack.svelte';\n            ${namedExports\n              .map(\n                (name) =>\n                  `export const ${name} = () => new RedirectBack();`\n              )\n              .join('\\n')}\n            ${defaultExport}\n          `,\n          map: null,\n        };\n      }\n    },\n  };\n}\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [StorybookUrlLinksPlugin(), svelte()],\n})\n```\n\nUpdate your Storybook configuration (i.e., `.storybook/main.js|ts`) to include the custom indexer.\n\n```\n// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using, e.g. sveltekit or svelte-vite\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\nimport type { Indexer } from 'storybook/internal/types';\n\nconst urlIndexer: Indexer = {\n  test: /\\.url\\.js$/,\n  createIndex: async (fileName, { makeTitle }) => {\n    const fileData = await import(fileName);\n\n    return Object.entries(fileData)\n      .filter(([key]) => key != 'default')\n      .map(([name, url]) => {\n        return {\n          type: 'docs',\n          importPath: fileName,\n          exportName: name,\n          title: makeTitle(name)\n            .replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, '$1 $2')\n            .trim(),\n          __id: `url--${name}--${encodeURIComponent(url as string)}`,\n          tags: ['!autodocs', 'url']\n        };\n      });\n  }\n};\n\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.@(js|ts|svelte)', '../src/**/*.url.js'],\n  framework: {\n    name: '@storybook/svelte-vite',\n    options: {},\n  },\n  experimental_indexers: async (existingIndexers) => [urlIndexer, ...existingIndexers]\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n\nAdd a Storybook UI configuration file (i.e., `.storybook/manager.js|ts`) to render the indexed URLs as sidebar links in the UI:\n\n```\nimport { addons } from 'storybook/manager-api';\n\nimport SidebarLabelWrapper from './components/SidebarLabelWrapper.tsx';\n\naddons.setConfig({\n    sidebar: {\n      renderLabel: (item) => SidebarLabelWrapper({ item }),\n    },\n});\n```\n\nThis example's code and live demo are available on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/Sidnioulz/storybook-sidebar-urls).\n\n</details>"

A builder also provides a development server for interactive development and a production mode for optimized bundles.\n\nTo opt into a builder, the user must add it as a dependency and then edit their configuration file (`.storybook/main.js`) to enable it. For example, with the Vite builder:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-vite-builder-install.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-vite-builder-register.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",

The generated output should contain everything the user needs to view its Storybook by opening either the `index.html` or `iframe.html` in a browser with no other processes running.",
            "Implementation": {
              "Import stories": "The `stories` configuration field enables story loading in Storybook. It defines an array of file globs containing the physical location of the component's stories. The builder must be able to load those files and monitor them for changes and update the UI accordingly.",
              "Provide configuration options": "By default, Storybook's configuration is handled in a dedicated file (`storybook/main.js|ts`), giving the user the option to customize it to suit its needs. The builder should also provide its own configuration support through additional fields or some other builder-appropriate mechanism. For example:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-builder-api-configuration-options.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",
              "Handle preview.js exports": "The [`preview.js`](../configure/index.mdx#configure-story-rendering) configuration file allows users to control how the story renders in the UI. This is provided via the [decorators](../writing-stories/decorators.mdx) named export. When Storybook starts, it converts these named exports into internal API calls via virtual module entry, for example, `addDecorator()`. The builder must also provide a similar implementation. For example:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-builder-api-preview-exports.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",

Nevertheless, depending on your project configuration, or the framework of choice, you may run into issues with TypeScript modules not being resolved within Storybook when aliased from your [`tsconfig` file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig). If you encounter this issue, you can use [`tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/dividab/tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin#tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin) while [extending Storybook's Webpack config](#override-the-default-configuration) as follows:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-main-ts-module-resolution.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nHowever, if you're working with a framework that provides a default aliasing configuration (e.g., Next.js, Nuxt) and you want to configure Storybook to use the same aliases, you may not need to install any additional packages. Instead, you can extend the default configuration of Storybook to use the same aliases provided by the framework. For example, to set up an alias for the `@` import path, you can add the following to your `.storybook/main.js|ts` file:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-main-ts-module-resolution-atsign-import.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",

Make sure to preserve the following config options:\n\n['**entry**', '**output**']\n\nFurthermore, `config` requires the `HtmlWebpackplugin` to generate the preview page, so rather than overwriting `config.plugins` you should probably append to it (or overwrite it with care), see [the following issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/6020) for examples on how to handle this:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-main-simplified-config.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nFinally, if your custom webpack config uses a loader that does not explicitly include specific file extensions via the `test` property, in that case, it is necessary to `exclude` the `.ejs` file extension from that loader.\n\nIf you're using a non-standard Storybook config directory, you should put `main.js` there instead of `.storybook` and update the `include` path to ensure it resolves to your project root.",

Powered by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), it improves performance and reduces build times. Storybook includes a built-in integration with SWC, allowing zero-configuration setup and built-in types for APIs. If you've initialized Storybook in a Webpack-based project with any of the supported [frameworks](./frameworks.mdx), except Angular, Create React App, Ember.js and Next.js, it will automatically use SWC as its default, providing you with faster loading time.\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\">\nSupport for the SWC builder is currently experimental for Next.js projects, and it's not enabled by default. It requires you to opt in to use it. For more information on configuring SWC with the supported frameworks, see the [SWC API](../../api/main-config/main-config-swc.mdx) documentation.\n</Callout>",

                  "Configure": "By default, Babel provides an opinionated [configuration](https://babeljs.io/docs/config-files) that works for most projects, relying on two distinct methods for configuring projects with the tool:\n\n[\"**Project-wide configuration**: Babel will look for a `babel.config.js` or equivalent file in the root of your project and use it to configure your project's Babel setup.\", '**File-relative configuration**: Babel will look for a `.babelrc.json` or equivalent file, introspecting the project structure until it finds a configuration file. This will allow you to configure Babel individually for multiple aspects of your project.']\n\nStorybook relies on an agnostic approach to configuring Babel, enabling you to provide the necessary configuration for your project, and it will use it. Based on the supported frameworks, builders, and addons, it may include minor adjustments to ensure compatibility with Storybook's features.\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\">\nFor custom project configurations such as monorepos, where you have multiple Storybook configurations, creating a `.babelrc.json` file in your project's current working directory may not be sufficient. In those cases, you can create a `babel.config.js` file to override Babel's configuration, and Storybook will automatically detect and use it. See the Babel [documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/config-files) for more information.\n</Callout>",
                  "Working with Create React App": "If you're working with a project that was initialized with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), Storybook will automatically detect and use the Babel configuration provided by the tool enabled via the `@storybook/preset-create-react-app` preset, allowing to use Storybook without any additional configuration."

                  "The SWC compiler doesn't work with React": "If you have enabled the SWC builder option in a React-based project and you are not explicitly importing React in your `jsx|tsx` files, it can cause Storybook to fail to load. SWC does not automatically import the `jsx-runtime` module when using the SWC builder. To resolve this issue, you need to adjust your Storybook configuration file (i.e., `.storybook/main.js|ts`) and configure the `swc` option as follows:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"main-config-swc-jsx-transform.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n</IfRenderer>",
                  "Babel configuration not working": "Out of the box, Storybook can detect and apply any Babel configuration you provided in your project. However, if you're running into a situation where your configuration is not being used, you configure the [`BABEL_SHOW_CONFIG_FOR`](https://babeljs.io/docs/configuration#print-effective-configs) environment variable and set it to the file you want to inspect. For example:\n\n```\nBABEL_SHOW_CONFIG_FOR=.storybook/preview.js yarn storybook\n```\n\nWhen the command runs, it will output the Babel configuration applied to the file you specified despite showing a transpilation error in the console and preventing Storybook from loading. This is a known issue with Babel unrelated to Storybook, which you address by turning off the environment variable after inspecting the configuration and restarting Storybook."

Note that we can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:\n\n```\n{\n  // extend plugin:storybook/<configuration>, such as:\n  \"extends\": [\"plugin:storybook/recommended\"]\n}\n```\n\nAnd finally, add this to your `.eslintignore` file:\n\n```\n!.storybook\n```\n\nThis ensures that the plugin will also lint your configuration files inside the `.storybook` directory, so that you always have a correct configuration. For example, it can catch mistyped addon names in your `main.js|ts` file.\n\nFor more details on why this line is required in the `.eslintignore` file, refer to the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore-deprecated#:~:text=In%20addition%20to,contents%20are%20ignored).\n\nIf you are using [flat config style](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new), add this to your configuration file:\n\n```\nexport default [\n  // ...\n  {\n    // Inside your .eslintignore file\n    ignores: ['!.storybook'],\n  },\n];\n```",

Unless you've set your preferred color scheme as dark, Storybook will use the light theme as default.\n\nAs an example, you can tell Storybook to use the \"dark\" theme by modifying [`.storybook/manager.js`](./features-and-behavior.mdx):\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-manager-dark-theme.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nWhen setting a theme, set a complete theme object.

                "Create a theme quickstart": "The easiest way to customize Storybook is to generate a new theme using the `create()` function from `storybook/theming`. This function includes shorthands for the most common theme variables. Here's how to use it:\n\nInside your `.storybook` directory, create a new file called `YourTheme.js` and add the following:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-theme-example-variables.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"💡\">\n\nIf you're using `brandImage` to add your custom logo, you can use any of the most common image formats.\n\n</Callout>\n\nAbove, we're creating a new theme that will:\n\n[\"Use Storybook's `light` theme as a baseline.\", \"Replace Storybook's logo in the sidebar with our own (defined in the brandImage variable).\", 'Add custom branding information.', 'Set the brand link to open in the same window (as opposed to a new one), via the `target` attribute.']\n\nFinally, we'll need to import the theme into Storybook. Create a new file called `manager.js` in your `.storybook` directory and add the following:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-manager-custom-theme.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nNow your custom theme will replace Storybook's default theme, and you'll see a similar set of changes in the UI.\n\n![Storybook starter theme](../../_assets/configure/storybook-starter-custom-theme.png)\n\nLet's take a look at a more complex example.

The types are part of the package itself.",
                "CSS escape hatches": "The Storybook theme API is narrow by design. If you want to have fine-grained control over the CSS, all UI and Docs components are tagged with class names to make this possible. **Use at your own risk** as this is an advanced feature.\n\nTo style these elements, insert style tags into:\n\n['For Storybook’s UI, use `.storybook/manager-head.html`', 'For Storybook Docs, use `.storybook/preview-head.html`']\n\n<Callout variant=\"warning\" title=\"Caution\">\nThe same way as you can adjust your [preview’s head tag](../story-rendering.mdx#adding-to-head), Storybook allows you to modify the code on the manager's side, through `.storybook/manager-head.html`. It can be helpful when adding theme styles that target Storybook's HTML, but it comes with a cost as Storybook's inner HTML can change at any time through the release cycle.\n</Callout>",
                "MDX component overrides": "If you're using MDX for docs, there's one more level of \"themability\". MDX allows you to completely override the rendered components from Markdown using a `components` parameter. It's an advanced usage that we don't officially support in Storybook, but it's a powerful construct if you need it.\n\nHere's how you might insert a custom code renderer for `code` blocks on the page, in [`.storybook/preview.js`](../index.mdx#configure-story-rendering):\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-preview-custom-code-renderer.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nYou can even override a Storybook block component.\n\nHere's how you might insert a custom `<Canvas />` block:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-preview-custom-canvas.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",

            "Goal": {
              "“Feature Request” vs. “RFC”": "A *feature request* is a straightforward and relatively informal way for Storybook users to suggest a new feature or enhancement to the project. While feature requests can provide valuable insights and ideas, they typically do not involve an in-depth design process or require consensus among the core team. Feature requests are usually open to discussion and may or may not be implemented based on factors like popularity, feasibility, and alignment with the project's goals.\n\nOn the other hand, an *RFC* is a more formalized and structured process for proposing substantial changes or additions to the project. It involves following a defined set of steps to ensure that the proposed feature or modification receives proper consideration, design, and feedback. RFCs are typically used for changes that significantly impact the project, such as introducing new API functionality, removing existing features, or establishing new usage conventions. The RFC process aims to foster discussions, gather feedback from a wider audience, and reach consensus among the core team before integrating the proposed change into the project. Accepted RFCs are more likely to be implemented than regular feature requests."
            },
            "The RFC lifecycle": {
              "1. `Status: Proposed`": "Open a new GitHub discussion in the [“RFC” category](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/new?category=rfc). Fill out the form as instructed.\n\n*Details matter*: RFCs that do not present convincing motivation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of the design's impact, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be poorly received.",
              "2. `Status: In review`": "RFCs tend to remain in this stage for a while, giving the community and core team members time to weigh in. During this period, the author of an RFC should be prepared to revise the proposal, integrate feedback, and build consensus. RFCs that have broad support are much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any comments.\n\nEvery week, the Storybook core team conducts a triage meeting to review open RFCs as part of the meeting's agenda. The event is publicly scheduled in the [Storybook Discord](https://discord.gg/storybook) and held in the [Storybook Discord's Watercooler channel](https://discord.com/channels/486522875931656193/486522876388704260). We invite the RFC author(s) and interested members of the community to participate and engage in a more detailed discussion of the RFC. If a core team member deems it necessary, they will be assigned as the \"champion\" of the RFC. The champion will collaborate with the RFC author and assist them throughout the RFC process.",
              "3. `Status: accepted/rejected`": "Eventually, the team will decide whether the RFC is a candidate for inclusion in Storybook. On the other hand, an RFC may be rejected by the team after a public discussion has settled and comments have been made summarizing the rationale for rejection."
            },
            "Implementing an accepted RFC": "The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the RFC author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an implementation for review after the RFC has been accepted. However, note that the “accepted” status does not indicate priority nor whether it’s being actively worked on.\n\nIf you are interested in implementing an \"active\" RFC, but cannot determine if someone else is already working on it, feel free to ask (e.g., by leaving a comment on the associated issue).\n\nThis RFC process took heavy inspiration from the RFC processes from [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/contributing/rfc-process/).\n\n**Learn more about contributing to Storybook**\n\n['RFC process for authoring feature requests', '[Code](./code.mdx) for features and bug fixes', '[Frameworks](./framework.mdx) to get started with a new framework', '[Documentation](./documentation/documentation-updates.mdx) for documentation improvements, typos, and clarifications', '[Examples](./documentation/new-snippets.mdx) for new snippets']"

            "Start developing": "Now that you've [verified your setup](#running-tests), it's time to jump into code. The simplest way is to run one of the sandboxes in one terminal window and the interactive build process in a separate terminal.\n\nAssuming you're still running the Vite-based React sandbox initialized after running the `yarn start` command, open a new terminal window and navigate to the `code` directory of the Storybook monorepo. Then, create a new branch for your contribution by running the following command:\n\n```\ngit checkout -b my-first-storybook-contribution\n```\n\nLastly, run the build process with the following:\n\n```\nyarn build\n```\n\nWhen prompted to start the build process in `watch` mode, answer **yes** to develop in interactive mode. Afterward, choose which packages you want to build. For example, if you're going to work on a feature for `@storybook/addon-docs`, you might want to select both `@storybook/addon-docs` and `storybook`.\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"💡\">\n\nBuild's `watch` mode is great for interactive development.

For example, a framework targeting SvelteKit would be `storybook-framework-svelte-kit` and a framework targeting Stencil with Vite would be `storybook-framework-stencil-vite`. When not targeting a metaframework, the naming convention is `storybook-framework-<renderer>-<builder>`.",
              "2. Consider what your framework will need to do": "The goal is to make Storybook behave—out-of-the-box—as similarly as possible to the metaframework or builder-renderer combination you’re targeting.\n\nFor metaframeworks, this means attempting to recreate any builder or babel configuration provided by the metaframework. You should try to do so in a way that respects the user's existing project configuration as much as possible.\n\nThe library or libraries your framework supports may have different major versions available. Consider which versions of each library your framework will support. You will need to account for the changes within those different versions or split your framework into different versions/packages itself to support each library version. To speed up maintenance, please consider adding integration tests for the various library versions your framework supports.",
              "3. Write the documentation": "Before writing any code, write a helpful README that contains installation instructions and a list of available features. Use the [README for `@storybook/nextjs`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/frameworks/nextjs/README.md) as a template. Writing the documentation first helps guide your other work.",

            "Setting globals on a story": "When a global value is changed with a toolbar menu in Storybook, that value continues to be used as you navigate between stories. But sometimes a story requires a specific value to render correctly, e.g., when testing against a particular environment.\n\nTo ensure that a story always uses a specific global value, regardless of what has been chosen in the toolbar, you can set the `globals` annotation on a story or component. This overrides the global value for those stories and disables the toolbar menu for that global when viewing the stories.\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"addon-backgrounds-define-globals.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nIn the example above, Storybook will force all Button stories to use a gray background color, except the `OnDark` story, which will use the dark background. For all Button stories, the toolbar menu will be disabled for the `backgrounds` global, with a tooltip explaining that the global is set at the story level.\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"💡\">\n\nConfiguring a story's `globals` annotation to override the project-level global settings is useful but should be used with moderation. Globals that are _not_ defined at the story level can be selected interactively in Storybook's UI, allowing users to explore every existing combination of values (e.g., global values, [`args`](../writing-stories/args.mdx)). Setting them at the story level will disable that control, preventing users from exploring the available options.\n\n</Callout>",
            "Advanced usage": "So far, we've created and used a global inside Storybook.\n\nNow, let's take a look at a more complex example. Suppose we wanted to implement a new global called **locale** for internationalization, which shows a flag on the right side of the toolbar.\n\nIn your [`.storybook/preview.js|ts`](../configure/index.mdx#configure-story-rendering), add the following:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-preview-locales-globaltype.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"💡\" style={{ marginBottom: '10px' }}>\n\nThe `icon` element used in the examples loads the icons from the `@storybook/icons` package. See [here](../faq.mdx#what-icons-are-available-for-my-toolbar-or-my-addon) for the list of available icons that you can use.\n\n</Callout>\n\nAdding the configuration element `right` will display the text on the right side in the toolbar menu once you connect it to a decorator.\n\nHere's a list of the available configuration options.\n\n| MenuItem  | Type   | Description                                                     | Required |\n| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| **value** | String | The string value of the menu that gets set in the globals       | Yes      |\n| **title** | String | The main text of the title                                      | Yes      |\n| **right** | String | A string that gets displayed on the right side of the menu      | No       |\n| **icon**  | String | An icon that gets shown in the toolbar if this item is selected | No       |",

However, if you want to use a specific package manager as the default, add the `--package-manager` flag to the installation command. For example:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"create-command-custom-package-manager.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nThe CLI doesn't detect my framework\n\nIf you're working with a custom environment setup or need to set up Storybook manually, you can use the `--type` flag to specify the framework you need to use. Listed below are the supported frameworks and examples of how to use them:\n\n| Framework      | Type             |\n| -------------- | ---------------- |\n| Angular        | `angular`        |\n| Ember          | `ember`          |\n| HTML           | `html`           |\n| Next.js        | `nextjs`         |\n| Preact         | `preact`         |\n| Qwik           | `qwik`           |\n| React          | `react`          |\n| Server         | `server`         |\n| Solid          | `solid`          |\n| Svelte         | `svelte`         |\n| Vue 3          | `vue3`           |\n| Web Components | `web_components` |\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"create-command-manual-framework.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nYarn Plug'n'Play (PnP) support with Storybook\n\nIf you've enabled Storybook in a project running on a new version of Yarn with [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) (PnP) enabled, you may notice that it will generate `node_modules` with some additional files and folders. This is a known constraint as Storybook relies on some directories (e.g., `.cache`) to store cache files and other data to improve performance and faster builds. You can safely ignore these files and folders, adjusting your `.gitignore` file to exclude them from the version control you're using.\n\nRun Storybook with Webpack 4\n\nIf you previously installed Storybook in a project that uses Webpack 4, it will no longer work. This is because Storybook now uses Webpack 5 by default. To solve this issue, we recommend you upgrade your project to Webpack 5 and then run the following command to migrate your project to the latest version of Storybook:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-automigrate.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\n<If notRenderer=\"angular\">\n\n#### Storybook doesn't work with an empty directory\n\nBy default, Storybook is configured to detect whether you're initializing it on an empty directory or an existing project. However, if you attempt to initialize Storybook, select a Vite-based framework (e.g., [React](./frameworks/react-vite.mdx)) in a directory that only contains a `package.json` file, you may run into issues with [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started). This is due to how Yarn handles peer dependencies and how Storybook is set up to work with Vite-based frameworks, as it requires the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) package to be installed. To solve this issue, you must install Vite manually and initialize Storybook.\n\n\n</If>\n\n<IfRenderer renderer=\"angular\">\n#### Storybook doesn't work with my Angular project using the Angular CLI\n\nOut of the box, adding Storybook to an Angular project using the Angular CLI requires you to run the installation command from the root of the project or, if you're working with a monorepo environment, from the directory where the Angular configuration file (i.e., `angular.json`) is located as it will be used to set up the builder configuration necessary to run Storybook. However, if you need, you can extend the builder configuration to customize Storybook's behavior. To learn more about the available options, see the [Angular framework documentation](./frameworks/angular.mdx#how-do-i-configure-angulars-builder-for-storybook).\n\n</IfRenderer>\n\n<IfRenderer renderer=\"ember\">\n#### The CLI doesn't support my Ember version\n\nThe Ember framework relies on an auxiliary package named [`@storybook/ember-cli-storybook`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/ember-cli-storybook) to help you set up Storybook in your project. During the installation process you might run into the following warning message in your terminal:\n\n```shell\nThe ember generate entity-name command requires an entity name to be specified.\nFor more details, use ember help.\n```\n\nIt may be the case that you're using an outdated version of the package and you need to update it to the latest version to solve this issue.\n\n</IfRenderer>\n\n<IfRenderer renderer=\"vue\">\n#### Storybook doesn't work with my Vue 2 project\n\nVue 2 entered [End of Life](https://v2.vuejs.org/lts/) (EOL) on December 31st, 2023, and is no longer maintained by the Vue team. As a result, Storybook no longer supports Vue 2. We recommend you upgrade your project to Vue 3, which Storybook fully supports.

There are three broad categories of configuration you might need.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Build configuration like Webpack and Babel</summary>\n\nIf you see errors on the CLI when you run the `yarn storybook` command, you likely need to make changes to Storybook’s build configuration. Here are some things to try:\n\n['[Presets](../addons/addon-types.mdx) bundle common configurations for various technologies into Storybook. In particular, presets exist for Create React App and Ant Design.', 'Specify a custom [Babel configuration](../configure/integration/compilers.mdx#babel) for Storybook.

Try patching in your own configuration if needed.\\n</details>']\n\n<details>\n<summary>Runtime configuration</summary>\n\nIf Storybook builds but you see an error immediately when connecting to it in the browser, in that case, chances are one of your input files is not compiling/transpiling correctly to be interpreted by the browser. Storybook supports evergreen browsers, but you may need to check the Babel and Webpack settings (see above) to ensure your component code works correctly.\n</details>\n\n<details id=\"component-context\" name=\"component-context\">\n<summary>Component context</summary>\n\nIf a particular story has a problem rendering, often it means your component expects a specific environment is available to the component.\n\nA common frontend pattern is for components to assume that they render in a specific “context” with parent components higher up the rendering hierarchy (for instance, theme providers).\n\nUse [decorators](../writing-stories/decorators.mdx) to “wrap” every story in the necessary context providers. The [`.storybook/preview.js|ts`](../configure/index.mdx#configure-story-rendering) file allows you to customize how components render in Canvas, the preview iframe. See how you can wrap every component rendered in Storybook with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) `ThemeProvider`, [Vue's Fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome), or with an Angular theme provider component in the example below.\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-preview-with-styled-components-decorator.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n</details>",

            "The problem": "The web’s universality is pushing more complexity into the frontend. It began with responsive web design, which turned every user interface from one to 10, 100, 1000 different user interfaces. Over time, additional requirements piled on like devices, browsers, accessibility, performance, and async states.\n\nComponent-driven tools like React, Vue 3, and Angular help break down complex UIs into simple components but they’re not silver bullets. As frontends grow, the number of components swells. Mature projects can contain hundreds of components that yield thousands of discrete variations.\n\nTo complicate matters further, those UIs are painful to debug because they’re entangled in business logic, interactive states, and app context.\n\nThe breadth of modern frontends overwhelm existing workflows. Developers must consider countless UI variations, yet aren’t equipped to develop or organize them all. You end up in a situation where UIs are tougher to build, less satisfying to work on, and brittle.\n\n![UI multiverse](../_assets/get-started/multiverse.png)",
            "The solution": {
              "Build UIs in isolation": "Every piece of UI is now a [component](https://www.componentdriven.org/). The superpower of components is that you don't need to spin up the whole app just to see how they render. You can render a specific variation in isolation by passing in props, mocking data, or faking events.\n\nStorybook is packaged as a small, development-only, [workshop](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-frontend-workshop-environment/) that lives alongside your app. It provides an isolated iframe to render components without interference from app business logic and context. That helps you focus development on each variation of a component, even the hard-to-reach edge cases.\n\n<Video src=\"../_assets/get-started/whats-a-story.mp4\" />",
              "Capture UI variations as “stories”": "When developing a component variation in isolation, save it as a story. [Stories](https://github.com/ComponentDriven/csf) are a declarative syntax for supplying props and mock data to simulate component variations. Each component can have multiple stories. Each story allows you to demonstrate a specific variation of that component to verify appearance and behavior.\n\nYou write stories for granular UI component variation and then use those stories in development, testing, and documentation.\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"histogram-story.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",

In the past, you'd have to spin up the app, navigate to a page, and contort the UI into the right state. This is a huge waste of time and bogs down frontend development. With Storybook, you can skip all those steps and jump straight to working on a UI component in a specific state.\n\n<Video src=\"../_assets/get-started/histogram-stories-optimized.mp4\" />\n\n<details>\n<summary>Where does Storybook fit into my project?</summary>\n\nStorybook is packaged as a small, development-only, [workshop](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-frontend-workshop-environment/) that lives alongside your app. Install it by [running a command](../get-started/install.mdx).\n\nDuring development, run it in a separate node process. If you’re working on UI in isolation, the only thing you’ll need to run is Storybook.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Does Storybook work with my favorite libraries?</summary>\n\nStorybook aims to integrate with industry-standard tools and platforms to simplify setup. Thanks to our ambitious developer community, we’ve made significant progress. There are hundreds of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/) and tutorials that walk through how to set up Storybook in all types of projects.\n\nIf you’re using a niche framework or a recently launched tool, we might not have an integration for it yet. Consider creating a [proof of concept](../addons/writing-addons.mdx) yourself first to lead the way for the rest of the community.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What’s the recommended Storybook workflow?</summary>\n\nEvery team is different and so is their workflow. Storybook is designed to be incrementally adoptable. Teams can gradually try features to see what works best for them.\n\nMost community members choose a [Component-Driven](https://www.componentdriven.org/) workflow. UIs are developed in isolation from the “bottom up” starting with basic components then progressively combined to assemble pages.\n\n['Build each component in isolation and write stories for its variations.', 'Compose small components together to enable more complex functionality.', 'Assemble pages by combining composite components.', 'Integrate pages into your project by hooking up data and business logic.\\n</details>']"

Verify hard-to-reach edge cases of UI. Use addons to mock everything a component needs—context, API requests, device features, etc.\n\n**✅ Test UIs with less effort and no flakes**\n\nStories are a pragmatic, reproducible way of tracking UI states. Use them to spot-test the UI during development. Storybook offers built-in workflows for automated [Interaction](../writing-tests/interaction-testing.mdx), [Accessibility](../writing-tests/accessibility-testing.mdx), and [Visual](../writing-tests/visual-testing.mdx) testing. Or use stories as test cases by [importing them into other JavaScript testing tools](../writing-tests/integrations/stories-in-unit-tests.mdx).\n\n**📚 Document UI for your team to reuse**\n\nStorybook is the single source of truth for your UI. Stories index all your components and their various states, making it easy for your team to find and reuse existing UI patterns. Storybook also auto-generates [documentation](../writing-docs/index.mdx) from those stories.\n\n**📤 Share how the UI actually works**\n\nStories show how UIs actually work, not just a picture of how they're supposed to work. That keeps everyone aligned on what's currently in production. [Publish Storybook](../sharing/publish-storybook.mdx) to get sign-off from teammates. Or [embed](../sharing/embed.mdx) them in wikis, Markdown, and Figma to streamline collaboration.\n\n**🚦Automate UI workflows**\n\nStorybook is compatible with your continuous integration workflow. Add it as a CI step to automate user interface testing, review implementation with teammates, and get signoff from stakeholders.",
            "Write stories once, reuse everywhere": "Storybook is powered by [Component Story Format](https://github.com/ComponentDriven/csf), an open standard based on JavaScript ES6 modules. This enables stories to interoperate between development, testing, and design tools. Each story is exported as a JavaScript function enabling you to reuse it with other tools. No vendor lock-in.\n\nReuse stories with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) to verify interactions. Put them in [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/?utm_source=storybook_website\\&utm_medium=link\\&utm_campaign=storybook) for visual testing. Audit story accessibility with [Axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core). Or test user flows with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Reuse unlocks more workflows at no extra cost.\n\n[]\n\nStorybook is purpose-built to help you develop complex UIs faster with greater durability and lower maintenance.

In short, it takes into account your `tsconfig.json`'s [baseUrl](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl) and [paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths). Thus, a `tsconfig.json` like the one below would work out of the box.\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
                "React Server Components (RSC)": "(⚠️ **Experimental**)\n\nIf your app uses [React Server Components (RSC)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), Storybook can render them in stories in the browser.\n\nTo enable this set the `experimentalRSC` feature flag in your `.storybook/main.js|ts` config:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"rsc-feature-flag.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nSetting this flag automatically wraps your story in a [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) wrapper, which is able to render asynchronous components in NextJS's version of React.\n\nIf this wrapper causes problems in any of your existing stories, you can selectively disable it using the `react.rsc` [parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/parameters) at the global/component/story level:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"rsc-parameter-in-meta.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nNote that wrapping your server components in Suspense does not help if your server components access server-side resources like the file system or Node-specific libraries. To work around this, you'll need to mock out your data access layer using [Webpack aliases](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) or an addon like [storybook-addon-module-mock](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-module-mock).\n\nIf your server components access data via the network, we recommend using the [MSW Storybook Addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/msw-storybook-addon) to mock network requests.\n\nIn the future we will provide better mocking support in Storybook and support for [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions).\n\n{/* ## Portable stories\n\nYou can test your stories in a Jest environment by using the [portable stories](../../api/portable-stories/portable-stories-jest.mdx) API.\n\nWhen using portable stories with Next.js, you need to mock the Next.js modules on which your components depend. You can use the [`@storybook/nextjs/export-mocks` module](#storybooknextjsexport-mocks) to generate the aliases needed to set up portable stories in a Jest environment. This is needed because, to replicate Next.js configuration, Storybook sets up aliases in Webpack to make testing and developing your components easier. If you make use of the advanced functionality like the built-in mocks for common Next.js modules, you need to set up this aliasing in your Jest environment as well. */}",

For example, you might get errors like:\n\n```\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'css-loader'\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'style-loader'\n```\n\nThis is because those versions of Yarn have different package resolution rules than Yarn v1.x.

                  "Stories for pages/components which fetch data": "Next.js pages can fetch data directly within server components in the `app` directory, which often include module imports that only run in a node environment. This does not (currently) work within Storybook, because if you import from a Next.js page file containing those node module imports in your stories, your Storybook's Webpack will crash because those modules will not run in a browser. To get around this, you can extract the component in your page file into a separate file and import that pure component in your stories. Or, if that's not feasible for some reason, you can [polyfill those modules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/node/) in your Storybook's [`webpackFinal` configuration](../../builders/webpack.mdx#extending-storybooks-webpack-config).\n\n**Before**\n\n```\nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch(...);\n  // ...\n}\n\n// Using this component in your stories will break the Storybook build\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const data = await getData();\n\n  return // ...\n}\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```\n// Use this component in your stories\nimport MyPage from './components/MyPage';\n\nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch(...);\n  // ...\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const data = await getData();\n\n  return <MyPage {...data} />;\n}\n```",
                  "Statically imported images won't load": "Make sure you are treating image imports the same way you treat them when using `next/image` in normal development.\n\nBefore using this framework, image imports would import the raw path to the image (e.g. `'static/media/stories/assets/logo.svg'`). Now image imports work the \"Next.js way\", meaning that you now get an object when importing an image. For example:\n\n```\n// Image import object\n{\n  \"src\": \"static/media/stories/assets/logo.svg\",\n  \"height\": 48,\n  \"width\": 48,\n  \"blurDataURL\": \"static/media/stories/assets/logo.svg\"\n}\n```\n\nTherefore, if something in Storybook isn't showing the image properly, make sure you expect the object to be returned from an import instead of only the asset path.\n\nSee [local images](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) for more detail on how Next.js treats static image imports.",

Each experimental feature comes with an [RFC](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/categories/rfc) where we share the initial idea and report progress.

In those cases, we provide automigrations where possible to ease the transition. We aim to collect feedback and iterate for 1-2 minor releases before promoting to stable.",

We use major releases to keep up with ecosystem changes, evolve Storybook’s architecture and APIs, and make the tool faster, leaner, and easier to use. \n\nOnce we start working on a major release, we pause minor releases but continue to ship patch releases as needed. Major releases go through a sequence of [pre-releases](#pre-release)—`alpha`, `beta`, and `rc` (release candidate)—before landing in the stable channel. We aim to include automated migrations and provide [a comprehensive migration guide](../releases/migration-guide.mdx) when manual changes are necessary.\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\">\nStorybook versions prior to 7 had a very different architecture. As a result, upgrading from v6 to newer versions can be more challenging. Starting in v7, we’ve focused heavily on smoother migrations. Upgrades from v7 to v8, and v8 to v9 (and beyond), should feel significantly easier thanks to automigrations and better tooling.\n</Callout>\n\nMinor Release\n\n**Cadence**: Roughly every 8 weeks\n\n**Channel**: Stable (`latest`)\n\nMinor releases deliver new features, enhancements, and non-breaking improvements. Each minor release may be preceded by an alpha [pre-release](#pre-release) (e.g. `x.y.0-alpha`).\n\nPatch Release\n\n**Cadence**: as needed (only for the current minor)\n\n**Channel**: Stable (`latest`)\n\nPatch releases include critical bug fixes and security updates. These are issued only for the current minor version and are not pre-released.\n\nPre-release\n\n**Cadence**: Regularly\n\n**Channel**: Pre-release (`next`)\n\nPre-releases are created to gather early feedback and ensure stability before an official release. Minor version stable releases are preceded by pre-releases with an `alpha` tag (e.g. `x.y.0-alpha`), with no patch pre-releases. Major version stable releases are preceded by a fuller cycle of `alpha`, `beta`, and `rc` pre-releases before the final release."

Community addons that work well with 7.x might not yet be compatible with 8.0, and this is the fastest way to isolate that possibility. If you find an addon that needs to be upgraded to work with Storybook 8, please post an issue on the addon’s repository, or better yet, a pull request to upgrade it!\", 'Another debugging technique is to bisect to older prerelease versions of Storybook to figure out which release broke your Storybook. For example, assuming that the current prerelease of Storybook is `8.0.0-beta.56`, you could set the version to `8.0.0-alpha.0` in your `package.json` and reinstall to verify that it still works (`alpha.0` should be nearly identical to `7.6.x`). If it works, you could then try `8.0.0-beta.0`, then `8.0.0-beta.28` and so forth. Once you’ve isolated the bad release, read through its [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/CHANGELOG.md) entry and perhaps there’s a change that jumps out as the culprit. If you find the problem, please submit an issue or pull request to the Storybook monorepo and we’ll do our best to take care of it quickly.']",

We’ll be on top of Storybook 9 issues as we’re stabilizing the release.']\n\nIf you prefer to debug yourself, here are a few useful things you can do to help narrow down the problem:\n\n[\"Try removing all addons that are not in the `@storybook` npm namespace (make sure you don't remove the `storybook` package). Community addons that work well with 8.x might not yet be compatible with 9.x, and this is the fastest way to isolate that possibility. If you find an addon that needs to be upgraded to work with Storybook 9, please post an issue on the addon’s repository, or better yet, a pull request to upgrade it!\", 'Another debugging technique is to bisect to older prerelease versions of Storybook to figure out which release broke your Storybook. For example, assuming that the current prerelease of Storybook is `9.0.0-beta.56`, you could set the version to `9.0.0-alpha.0` in your `package.json` and reinstall to verify that it still works (`alpha.0` should be nearly identical to `8.6.x`). If it works, you could then try `9.0.0-beta.0`, then `9.0.0-beta.28` and so forth. Once you’ve isolated the bad release, read through its [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/CHANGELOG.prerelease.md) entry and perhaps there’s a change that jumps out as the culprit. If you find the problem, please submit an issue or pull request to the Storybook monorepo and we’ll do our best to take care of it quickly.']",

              "MDX and CSF": "The first thing you'll notice is that the component documentation is divided into distinct formats: one for writing component stories describing each possible component state and the second one for documenting how to use them. This split leverages the best qualities of each format:\n\n['**CSF** is great for succinctly defining stories (component examples). If you use TypeScript, it also provides type safety and auto-completion.', '**MDX** is great for writing structured documentation and composing it with interactive JSX elements.']",
              "Anatomy of MDX": "Assuming you’re already familiar with writing stories with [CSF](../writing-stories/index.mdx), we can dissect the MDX side of things in greater detail.\n\nThe document consists of a number of blocks separated by blank lines. Since MDX mixes a few different languages together, it uses those blank lines to help distinguish where one starts, and the next begins. Failing to separate blocks by whitespace can cause (sometimes cryptic) parse errors.\n\nGoing through the code blocks in sequence:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n```\n{ /* Checkbox.mdx */ }\n```\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nComments in MDX are JSX blocks that contain JS comments.\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-auto-docs-mdx-docs-imports.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nImports the components and stories that will be used in the JSX throughout the rest of the file.\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-auto-docs-mdx-docs-meta-block.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\">\nWhen providing the `of` prop to the `Meta` block, make sure that you're referencing the [**default export**](../api/csf.mdx#default-export) of the story file and not the component itself to prevent render issues with the generated documentation.\n</Callout>\n\nThe `Meta` block defines where the document will be placed in the sidebar. In this case, it is adjacent to the Checkbox’s stories. By default, the docs sidebar node is titled `\"Docs\"`, but this can be customized by passing a `name` prop (e.g., `<Meta of={CheckboxStories} name=\"Info\" />`). If you want to place a docs node at an arbitrary point in the navigation hierarchy, you can use the `title` prop (e.g., `<Meta title=\"path/to/node\" />`).\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-auto-docs-mdx-docs-definition.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nMDX supports standard markdown ([\"commonmark\"](https://commonmark.org/)) by default and can be extended to support [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and other extensions (see the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) to learn more about some of the current limitations).\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-auto-docs-mdx-docs-story.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nFinally, MDX supports blocks of arbitrary JSX.\n\nIn this case, we are leveraging “Doc Blocks”, a library of documentation components designed to work with Storybook stories to show your stories, your component APIs & controls for interacting with your components inside your documentation, among other utilities.\n\nIn addition to Doc Blocks, MDX can incorporate arbitrary React components, making it a very flexible documentation system. Suppose you want a stylized list of “dos and don’ts” for your component; you can use off-the-shelf components or write your own.\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-auto-docs-mdx-docs-dos-donts.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",

              "Linking to other stories and pages": "Another way to improve documentation is by linking to other stories and pages. Suppose you already have a component story with the following unique identifier, `some--id`, and you want to link it to your documentation page. In that case, you can use the `path` query string to redirect to the documentation entry related to the story:\n\n```\n[Go to specific documentation page](?path=/docs/some--id)\n```\n\nInstead, if you need to target a specific documentation section, you can adjust the link to point at it. For example:\n\n```\n[Go to the conclusion of the documentation page](?path=/docs/some--id#conclusion)\n```\n\nHowever, cross-linking documentation isn't restricted to documentation pages. You can adjust the `path` query and supply the story's unique identifier if you need to reference a specific one. For example:\n\n{/*This redirects to the **Canvas** tab of the story: */}\n\n```\n[Go to specific story canvas](?path=/story/some--id)\n```\n\n{/*You can also use anchors to target a specific section of a page: */}\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"💡\">\n\nApplying this pattern with the [Controls](../essentials/controls.mdx) feature, all anchors will be ignored in Canvas based on how Storybook handles URLs to track the args values.\n\n</Callout>"

With args, you can directly compose the arguments:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"page-story.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",
            "Args can modify any aspect of your component": "You can use args in your stories to configure the component's appearance, similar to what you would do in an application. For example, here's how you could use a `footer` arg to populate a child component:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"page-story-slots.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",
            "Setting args through the URL": "You can also override the set of initial args for the active story by adding an `args` query parameter to the URL. Typically, you would use [Controls](../essentials/controls.mdx) to handle this. For example, here's how you could set a `size` and `style` arg in the Storybook's URL:\n\n```\n?path=/story/avatar--default&args=style:rounded;size:100\n```\n\nAs a safeguard against [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) attacks, the arg's keys and values provided in the URL are limited to alphanumeric characters, spaces, underscores, and dashes. Any other types will be ignored and removed from the URL, but you can still use them with the Controls panel and [within your story](#mapping-to-complex-arg-values).\n\nThe `args` param is always a set of `key: value` pairs delimited with a semicolon `;`. Values will be coerced (cast) to their respective `argTypes` (which may have been automatically inferred). Objects and arrays are supported. Special values `null` and `undefined` can be set by prefixing with a bang `!`. For example, `args=obj.key:val;arr[0]:one;arr[1]:two;nil:!null` will be interpreted as:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-args-url-params-converted.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nSimilarly, special formats are available for dates and colors. Date objects will be encoded as `!date(value)` with value represented as an ISO date string. Colors are encoded as `!hex(value)`, `!rgba(value)` or `!hsla(value)`. Note that rgb(a) and hsl(a) should not contain spaces or percentage signs in the URL.\n\nArgs specified through the URL will extend and override any default values of args set on the story.\n\n<IfRenderer renderer=\"react\">",
            "Setting args from within a story": "Interactive components often need to be controlled by their containing component or page to respond to events, modify their state and reflect those changes in the UI. For example, when a user toggles a switch component, the switch should be checked, and the arg shown in Storybook should reflect the change.

            "Mapping to complex arg values": "Complex values such as JSX elements cannot be serialized to the manager (e.g., the Controls panel) or synced with the URL. Arg values can be \"mapped\" from a simple string to a complex type using the `mapping` property in `argTypes` to work around this limitation. It works in any arg but makes the most sense when used with the `select` control type.\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"arg-types-mapping.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nNote that `mapping` does not have to be exhaustive. If the arg value is not a property of `mapping`, the value will be used directly.

The decorators provide runtime metadata, but do not offer metadata at compile time.\n\n  As a result, it appears impossible to determine if a property in the class is a required property or an optional property (but non-nullable due to a default value) or a non-nullable internal state variable.\n\n  For more information, please refer to [this discussion](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/20988).\n</details>\n\n</Callout>\n</IfRenderer>\n\nIf you are using TypeScript 4.9+, you can take advantage of the new [`satisfies`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html) operator to get stricter type checking. Now you will receive type errors for missing required args, not just invalid ones.\n\nUsing `satisfies` to apply a story's type helps maintain type safety when sharing a [play function](./play-function.mdx) across stories. Without it, TypeScript will throw an error that the `play` function may be undefined. The `satisfies` operator enables TypeScript to infer whether the play function is defined or not.\n\nFinally, use of `satisfies` allows you to pass `typeof meta` to the `StoryObj` generic. This informs TypeScript of the connection between the `meta` and `StoryObj` types, which allows it to infer the `args` type from the `meta` type. In other words, TypeScript will understand that args can be defined both at the story and meta level and won't throw an error when a required arg is defined at the meta level, but not at the story level.",

Instead, you must wrap it in your own module, which you can mock like any other internal one. For example, with `uuid`, you could do the following:\n\n```\nimport { v4 } from 'uuid';\n\nexport const uuidv4 = v4;\n```\n\nAnd create a mock for the wrapper:\n\n```\nimport { fn } from 'storybook/test';\n\nimport * as actual from './uuid';\n\nexport const uuidv4 = fn(actual.uuidv4).mockName('uuidv4');\n```",

The `default` key should come last.\n\nThird, note the **`storybook`, `test`, and `default` keys** in each module's entry. The `storybook` value is used to import the mock file when loaded in Storybook, while the `default` value is used to import the original module when loaded in your project. The `test` condition is also used within Storybook, which allows you to use the same configuration in Storybook and your other tests.\n\nWith the package configuration in place, you can then update your component file to use the subpath import:\n\n```\n// ➖ Remove this line\n// import { getUserFromSession } from '../../lib/session';\n// ➕ Add this line\nimport { getUserFromSession } from '#lib/session';\n\n// ...rest of the file\n```\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\">\nSubpath imports will only be correctly resolved and typed when the [`moduleResolution` property](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#moduleResolution) is set to `'Bundler'`, `'NodeNext'`, or `'Node16'` in your TypeScript configuration.\n\nIf you are currently using `'node'`, that is intended for projects using a Node.js version older than v10.

For example, you might want to test a component with different themes or user roles.\n\nOne way to do this is to define the decorator for each story individually. But if you imagine a scenario where you wish to create stories for each of your components in both light and dark themes, this approach can quickly become cumbersome.\n\nFor a better way, with much less repetition, you can use the [decorator function's second \"context\" argument](../decorators.mdx#context-for-mocking) to access a story's [`parameters`](../parameters.mdx) and adjust the provided value. This way, you can define the provider once and adjust its value for each story.\n\nFor example, we can adjust the decorator from above to read from `parameters.theme` to determine which theme to provide:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"mock-provider-in-preview.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nNow, you can define a `theme` parameter in your stories to adjust the theme provided by the decorator:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"configure-mock-provider-with-story-parameter.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nThis powerful approach allows you to provide any value (theme, user role, mock data, etc.) to your components in a way that is both flexible and maintainable.\n</If>"

The parameter accepts three values:\n\n| Value     | Description                                                                              |\n| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `'off'`   | Do not run accessibility tests (you can still manually verify via the addon panel)       |\n| `'todo'`  | Run accessibility tests; violations return a warning in the Storybook UI                 |\n| `'error'` | Run accessibility tests; violations return a failing test in the Storybook UI and CLI/CI |\n\nLike other parameters, you can define it at the project level in `.storybook/preview.js|ts`, the component level in the default export of the story file, or the individual story level. For example, to fail on accessibility tests for all stories in a file except one:\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"addon-a11y-parameter-example.md\" />\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\">\n\nWhy is the value called \"todo\" instead of \"warn\"? This value is intended to serve as a literal `TODO` in your codebase. It can be used to mark stories that you know have accessibility issues but are not ready to fix yet. This way, you can keep track of them and address them later.\n\nThe `'off'` value should only be used for stories that do not need to be tested for accessibility, such as one used to demonstrate an antipattern in a component's usage.\n\nYou can also [disable individual rules](#individual-rules) when they are not applicable to your use case.\n\n</Callout>",
              "Excluded elements": "Sometimes, it may be necessary to exclude certain elements from the accessibility checks. For this, you can define a custom [context](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/API.md#context-parameter) to select which elements are included (or excluded) when running checks. For example, this story will ignore elements with the class `no-a11y-check`:\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"addon-a11y-config-context-in-story.md\" />",

              "What’s the difference between browser-based and linter-based accessibility tests?": "Browser-based accessibility tests, like those found in Storybook, evaluate the rendered DOM because that gives you the highest accuracy. Auditing code that hasn't been compiled yet is one step removed from the real thing, so you won't catch everything the user might experience.",
              "Why are my tests failing in different environments?": "With the [Vitest addon](./integrations/vitest-addon.mdx), your tests run in Vitest using your project's configuration with Playwright's Chromium browser. This can lead to inconsistent test results reported in the Storybook UI or CLI. The inconsistency can be due to `axe-core` reporting different results in different environments, such as browser versions or configurations. If you encounter this issue, we recommend reaching out using the default communication channels (e.g., [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/new?category=help), [Github issues](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)).",
              "The addon panel does not show expected violations": "Modern React components often use asynchronous techniques like [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) or [React Server Components (RSC)](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) to handle complex data fetching and rendering. These components don’t immediately render their final UI state. Storybook doesn’t inherently know when an async component has fully rendered. As a result, the a11y checks sometimes run too early, before the component finishes rendering, leading to false negatives (no reported violations even if they exist).\n\nTo address this issue, we have introduced a feature flag: `developmentModeForBuild`. This feature flag allows you to set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `'development'` in built Storybooks, enabling development-related optimizations that are typically disabled in production builds. One of those development optimizations is React’s [`act` utility](https://react.dev/reference/react/act), which helps ensure that all updates related to a test are processed and applied before making assertions, like a11y checks.\n\nTo enable this feature flag, add the following configuration to your `.storybook/main.js|ts` file:\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"main-config-features-development-mode-for-build.md\" />\n\n**More testing resources**\n\n['[Vitest addon](./integrations/vitest-addon.mdx) for running tests in Storybook', '[Interaction testing](./interaction-testing.mdx) for user behavior simulation', '[Visual testing](./visual-testing.mdx) for appearance', '[Snapshot testing](./snapshot-testing.mdx) for rendering errors and warnings', '[Test coverage](./test-coverage.mdx) for measuring code coverage', '[CI](./in-ci.mdx) for running tests in your CI/CD pipeline', '[End-to-end testing](./integrations/stories-in-end-to-end-tests.mdx) for simulating real user scenarios', '[Unit testing](./integrations/stories-in-unit-tests.mdx) for functionality', '[Test runner](./integrations/test-runner.mdx) to automate test execution']"

When running locally, this points to your local Storybook running at `localhost:6006`. But in CI, there is no active Storybook. Instead, you must first build and publish your Storybook, then inform the Vitest addon where your Storybook is published so that it can print useful story links.\n\nHere's an example using GitHub Actions. The steps are similar for other CI providers, though details in the syntax or configuration may vary.\n\nWhen deployments for services like Vercel, GitHub Pages, and others are performed, they follow a pattern of emitting a `deployment_status` event containing the newly generated URL under `deployment_status.environment_url`. This is the URL to the published Storybook instance.\n\nWe can pass that URL to the command using an environment variable, `SB_URL`.\n\n```\nname: Storybook Tests\n\n+ # 👇 Update this to only run when a deployment status is emitted\n+ on: deployment_status\n- on: [push]\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container:\n      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.52.0-noble\n+   # 👇 Only run on successful deployments\n+   if: github.event_name == 'deployment_status' && github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: 22.12.0\n          \n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n\n      - name: Run tests\n        run: npm run test-storybook\n+       # 👇 Pass the Storybook URL as an environment variable\n+       env:\n+         SB_URL: '${{ github.event.deployment_status.environment_url }}'\n```\n\nFinally, we update the plugin configuration to use that environment variable in the [`storybookUrl` plugin option](./integrations/vitest-addon.mdx#storybookurl).\n\n```\nexport default defineWorkspace([\n  // ...\n  {\n    // ...\n    {\n      plugins: [\n        storybookTest({\n          // ...\n+         // 👇 Use the environment variable you passed\n+         storybookUrl: process.env.SB_URL\n        }),\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n])\n```\n\nNow, when a test fails in CI, the printed story URL will point to the published Storybook, making debugging that failure a breeze!",

Additionally, many tests can be debugged with an addon panel.\n\n![Storybook app with story status indicators, testing widget, and interactions panel annotated](../_assets/writing-tests/testing-ui-overview.png)\n\nIf you cannot use the Vitest addon in your project, you can still run tests using the [test-runner](./integrations/test-runner.mdx).\n\nNext, we’ll cover some key concepts of testing in Storybook.",
            "Key concepts": {
              "Component tests": "A component test is a test which:\n\n['Renders a component in the browser for high fidelity', 'Simulates a user interacting with actual UI, like an end-to-end (E2E) test', 'Only tests a unit (e.g. a single component) of UI, **and** can reach into the implementation to mock things or manipulate data, like a unit test']\n\nThis combination of using a real browser, simulating behavior, and mocking provides a powerful means of testing the functional aspects of your UI.\n\nIn Storybook, the entire testing experience is built around component tests. This means that you can run your tests in the same environment as your stories, with the same tools and techniques.",
              "Storybook Test": "Storybook Test enables real time testing of your stories, through the [Vitest addon](./integrations/vitest-addon.mdx). It uses a Vitest plugin to automatically transform your stories into real Vitest tests, which are then run with Vitest’s browser mode.",
              "Watch mode": "Get instant test feedback as you develop with watch mode. It will watch your code—either the component source or the tests—for changes and automatically re-run only the relevant tests. It’s perfect for test-driven development, where you write your tests first and then the component.\n\nTo activate watch mode, press the watch mode button (the eye icon) in the testing widget:\n\n![Testing widget with watch mode enabled](../_assets/writing-tests/test-widget-watch-mode-enabled.png)",
              "CI": "If you’re not running Storybook Test as part of your CI, you’re missing out on the biggest benefit it provides: catching bugs on PRs before you merge them.\n\nIf you are already running `vitest` as part of your CI then your stories should automatically run as tests “for free” when you commit your changes to Git.\n\nIf you’re not yet running Vitest in CI, you should set that up. First by adding a new script to your `package.json`:\n\n```\n{ \n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test-storybook\": \"vitest --project=storybook\"\n  }\n}  \n```\n\nNote that this assumes you have a Vitest project called “storybook” for your stories, which is the default configuration when you install Storybook Test. If you’ve renamed it, adjust the script accordingly.\n\nNext, add a new CI workflow. \n\n<details>\n<summary>If you use Github Actions that would look like:</summary>\n\n```\nname: Storybook Tests\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container:\n      # Make sure to grab the latest version of the Playwright image\n      # https://playwright.dev/docs/docker#pull-the-image\n      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.52.0-noble\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      \n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: 22.12.0\n      \n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n      \n      - name: Run tests\n        run: npm run test-storybook\n```\n\n</details>\n\nIf you are using a different CI provider, please consult our full [CI guide](./in-ci.mdx) for more information.\n\nStorybook Test uses Playwright to render your stories by default. For the fastest experience, you should use [a machine image that has Playwright already installed](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker#pull-the-image) (as in the snippet above).",
              "Coverage": {
                "Coverage in CI": "And while we’re looking at coverage, update your CI workflow to include it:\n\n```\n- yarn test\n+ yarn test --coverage\n```\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"💡\">\n\nWhy are we running all tests (`yarn test`) instead of just the Storybook tests (`yarn test-storybook`)? Because a coverage report is most accurate when accounting for all tests in your project, not just the stories you've written.\n\nSeeing [Storybook-specific coverage](./test-coverage.mdx#storybook-ui) can be helpful, but in CI output, you want to see the comprehensive coverage of your project.\n\n</Callout>\n\nThis way we can track the coverage change in every PR.\n\nThose are the key concepts you’ll need to test in Storybook. Now, let’s look at the different types of tests you can perform."

            "Types of tests": {
              "Render tests": "The most important tool for testing your components in Storybook is stories that render your components in various states. \n\nHowever, you might not be aware that a basic story is also a [smoke test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)), which we call a **render test**. The test passes when the story renders successfully and fails when it errors.\n\n![Storybook app showing a failing render test](../_assets/writing-tests/interactions-test-failure-render.png)\n\nDepending on the complexity of your components, you might be able to capture many of your key UI states this way.",
              "[Interaction tests](./interaction-testing.mdx)": "Render tests are a very basic kind of interaction test. To test stateful components or verify interactive behavior, you define a play function for your story:\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"interaction-test-simple.md\" />\n\nBut `play` functions can also be used for setting up state, creating spies, mocking out the network, simulating user interactions with your components, asserting output, and more. They are the meat and potatoes of testing and are the foundation for the rest of your testing journey in Storybook. \n\nHere’s a more complex example, which includes [spying and mocking](./interaction-testing.mdx#spying-on-functions-with-fn) via the `fn` utility.\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"interaction-test-complex.md\" />\n\nFor more information on how to write interaction tests and mocks using the `play` function, please see the [interaction testing guide](./interaction-testing.mdx#writing-interaction-tests).",
              "[Accessibility tests](./accessibility-testing.mdx)": "Storybook’s [Accessibility (A11y) addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-a11y) runs a set of automated checks on your stories to help ensure your components can be used by all users, regardless of ability or technology they're using. That means supporting requirements such as: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, usable color contrast, etc.\n\nAccessibility is not only the right thing to do, but it is increasingly mandated. For example, the [European accessibility act](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202) is scheduled to go into law in June 2025. Similarly in the US, laws like the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) and [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.section508.gov/) apply to many public-facing services.\n\nTo activate accessibility checks alongside your component tests, check the Accessibility checkbox in the testing widget.\n\n![Testing widget with accessibility activated](../_assets/writing-tests/test-widget-a11y-enabled.png)\n\nOnce activated, you will see accessibility failures in the sidebar.\n\n![Storybook showing a failing accessibility test in both the sidebar story menu and the Accessibility panel](../_assets/writing-tests/test-a11y-overview.png)\n\nAny failures can be debugged in the Accessibility addon panel.\n\n![Storybook app with accessibility panel open, showing violations and an interactive popover on the violating elements in the preview](../_assets/writing-tests/addon-a11y-debug-violations.png)",
              "[Visual tests](./visual-testing.mdx)": "Visual tests are the most efficient way to test your components. With the click of a button you can take snapshots of every story in your Storybook and compare those snapshots to baselines — last known “good” snapshots. Not only does this allow you to check the appearance of your components, but they are also able to check a large subset of component functionality [without having to write or maintain any test code](https://storybook.js.org/blog/visual-testing-is-the-greatest-trick-in-ui-development/)!\n\nStorybook supports cross-browser visual testing natively using [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/storybook/?ref=storybook_site), a cloud service made by the Storybook team. When you enable visual testing, every story is automatically turned into a test. This gives you instant feedback on UI bugs directly in Storybook.\n\n![Visual test panel with diff](../_assets/writing-tests/vta-changes-found.png)",
              "[Snapshot tests](./snapshot-testing.mdx)": "In most cases, the other testing types will provide more coverage with less effort.

We recommend combining them with other methods like visual testing for comprehensive coverage with less maintenance work.\n\nWhat's the difference between interaction tests and using Vitest + Testing Library alone?\n\nInteraction tests integrate Vitest and Testing Library into Storybook. The biggest benefit is the ability to view the component you're testing in a real browser. That helps you debug visually, instead of getting a dump of the (fake) DOM in the command line or hitting the limitations of how JSDOM mocks browser functionality. It's also more convenient to keep stories and tests together in one file than having them spread across files.\n\n**More testing resources**\n\n['[Vitest addon](./integrations/vitest-addon.mdx) for running tests in Storybook', '[Accessibility testing](./accessibility-testing.mdx) for accessibility', '[Visual testing](./visual-testing.mdx) for appearance', '[Snapshot testing](./snapshot-testing.mdx) for rendering errors and warnings', '[Test coverage](./test-coverage.mdx) for measuring code coverage', '[CI](./in-ci.mdx) for running tests in your CI/CD pipeline', '[End-to-end testing](./integrations/stories-in-end-to-end-tests.mdx) for simulating real user scenarios', '[Unit testing](./integrations/stories-in-unit-tests.mdx) for functionality', '[Test runner](./integrations/test-runner.mdx) to automate test execution']"

They’re convenient to create, but can be difficult and noisy to maintain if the snapshot contains too much information. For UI components, [visual tests](./visual-testing.mdx) (easier to review) or [interaction tests](./interaction-testing.mdx) (focused on functionality) are usually the better fit. However, there are some cases where snapshot testing may be necessary, such as ensuring an error is thrown correctly.\n\nYou can reuse your stories as the basis of snapshot tests within another test environment, like Jest or Vitest. To enable this, Storybook provides the Portable Stories API, which composes your stories with their annotations ([args](../writing-stories/args.mdx), [decorators](../writing-stories/decorators.mdx), [parameters](../writing-stories/parameters.mdx), etc) and produces a renderable element for your tests. Portable Stories are available for:\n\n['[Vitest](../api/portable-stories/portable-stories-vitest.mdx)', '[Jest](../api/portable-stories/portable-stories-jest.mdx)', '[Playwright CT](../api/portable-stories/portable-stories-playwright.mdx)']\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\">\n\nLooking for snapshot testing with Storyshots?

            "Get started with Portable Stories": "If you’re using Storybook Test, your project is already configured to use Portable Stories in Vitest.\n\nIf you’re not using Storybook Test or would like to test in another testing environment, please follow the relevant documentation:\n\n['[Vitest](../api/portable-stories/portable-stories-vitest.mdx#1-apply-project-level-annotations)', '[Jest](../api/portable-stories/portable-stories-jest.mdx#1-apply-project-level-annotations)', '[Playwright CT](../api/portable-stories/portable-stories-playwright.mdx#1-apply-project-level-annotations)']",

              "Verifying an error is thrown": "Now that we know how to do general snapshot testing, let’s apply it to a common use case: verifying that an expected error is thrown correctly.\n\nIn this example, we have a simple Button React component which for some reason accepts a prop, `doNotUseThisItWillThrowAnError`, which will (unsurprisingly) throw an error if it is used.\n\n```\nfunction Button(props) {\n  if (props.doNotUseThisItWillThrowAnError) {\n    throw new Error(\"I tried to tell you...\")\n  }\n\n  return <button {...props} />\n}\n```\n\nWe then have a story which applies that prop via `args`. It also removes the default `dev` and `test` tags to prevent the story from displaying in the Storybook sidebar and from being tested as a story (by Storybook Test), respectively.\n\n```\nexport const ThrowError = {\n  tags: ['!dev', '!test'],\n  args: {\n    doNotUseThisItWillThrowAnError: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we write a test in the test file which asserts that an error is thrown with a particular message.\n\n```\n// @vitest-environment jsdom\n\nimport { expect, test } from \"vitest\";\n\nimport { composeStories } from \"@storybook/react\";\n\nimport * as stories from \"./Button.stories\";\n\nconst { ThrowError } = composeStories(stories);\n\ntest(\"Button throws error\", async () => {\n  await expect(ThrowError.run()).rejects.toThrowError('I tried to tell you...');\n});\n```\n\nThis example is simplified for educational purposes. The same technique could be applied to more complex scenarios, such as a form with invalid input or a simulated network failure."

For example, if you had the following story:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"login-form-with-play-function.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"💡\">\nThe play function contains small snippets of code that run after the story renders. It allows you to sequence interactions in stories.\n</Callout>\n\nWith Cypress, you could write the following test:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"component-cypress-test.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nWhen Cypress runs your test, it loads Storybook's isolated iframe and checks if the inputs match the test values.",

It offers cross-browser automation, mobile testing with device emulation, and headless testing. With Component Story Format, your stories are reusable with Playwright. Each named export (in other words, a story) is renderable within your testing setup.\n\nA real-life scenario of user flow testing with Playwright would be how to test a login form for validity.

For example, you may want to always test a story in a particular locale (via `globalTypes`) or configure a story to apply specific `decorators` or `parameters`.\n\nTo avoid this, you can override the global configurations by extending either the `composeStory` or `composeStories` functions to provide test-specific configurations.

                "What's the difference between Chromatic and Test runner?": "The test-runner is a generic testing tool that can run locally or on CI and be configured or extended to run all kinds of tests.\n\n[Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/?utm_source=storybook_website\\&utm_medium=link\\&utm_campaign=storybook) is a cloud-based service that runs [visual](../visual-testing.mdx) and [interaction tests](../interaction-testing.mdx) (and soon [accessibility tests](../accessibility-testing.mdx)) without setting up the test runner. It also syncs with your git provider and manages access control for private projects.\n\nHowever, you might want to pair the test runner and Chromatic in some cases.\n\n['Use it locally and Chromatic on your CI.', 'Use Chromatic for visual and component tests and run other custom tests using the test runner.']",
                "Troubleshooting": {

Perhaps you have a large number of stories, or your CI environment has a really low RAM configuration. In such cases, you should limit the number of workers that run in parallel by adjusting your command as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test-storybook:ci\": \"yarn test-storybook --maxWorkers=2\"\n  }\n}\n```",
                  "The error output in the CLI is too short": "By default, the test runner truncates error outputs at 1000 characters, and you can check the full output directly in Storybook in the browser. However, if you want to change that limit, you can do so by setting the `DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT` environment variable to a number of your choosing, for example, `DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT=5000 yarn test-storybook`.",
                  "Run the test runner in other CI environments": "As the test runner is based on Playwright, you might need to use specific docker images or other configurations depending on your CI setup. In that case, you can refer to the [Playwright CI docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci) for more information.",
                  "Tests filtered by tags are incorrectly executed": "If you've enabled filtering tests with tags and provided similar tags to the `include` and `exclude` lists, the test-runner will execute the tests based on the `exclude` list and ignore the `include` list. To avoid this, make sure the tags provided to the `include` and `exclude` lists differ.",
                  "The test runner doesn't support Yarn PnP out of the box": "If you've enabled the test-runner in a project running on a newer version of Yarn with Plug'n'Play (PnP) enabled, the test-runner might not work as expected and may generate the following error when running tests:\n\n```\nPlaywrightError: jest-playwright-preset: Cannot find playwright package to use chromium\n```\n\nThis is due to the test-runner using the community-maintained package [jest-playwright-preset](https://github.com/playwright-community/jest-playwright) that still needs to support this feature. To solve this, you can either switch the [`nodeLinker`](https://yarnpkg.com/features/linkers) setting to `node-modules` or install Playwright as a direct dependency in your project, followed by adding the browser binaries via the [`install`](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#install-browsers) command.",
                  "Run test coverage in other frameworks": "If you intend on running coverage tests in frameworks with special files like Vue 3 or Svelte, you'll need to adjust your configuration and enable the required file extensions. For example, if you're using Vue, you'll need to add the following to your nyc configuration file (i.e., `.nycrc.json` or `nyc.config.js`):\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-coverage-report-vue.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",

This is due to how the flag works, as it removes addons that have an impact on performance (e.g., [`Docs`](../../writing-docs/index.mdx), [coverage addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-coverage)). To resolve this issue, you'll need to adjust your Storybook configuration file (i.e., `.storybook/main.js|ts`) and include the [`disabledAddons`](../../api/main-config/main-config-build.mdx#testdisabledaddons) option to allow the addon to run tests at the expense of a slower build.\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"storybook-coverage-addon-optimized-config.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}",

The sub-types listed under component tests will all run together, including when watch mode (which will automatically re-run relevant tests upon code changes) is enabled (with the eye icon).\n\n![Screenshot of testing widget, expanded, showing test types and watch mode toggle](../../_assets/writing-tests/test-widget-expanded.png)\n\n<Callout variant=\"info\" icon=\"ℹ️\">\n\nIf you have the [Visual tests addon](../visual-testing.mdx) installed, you'll see an option to run Visual tests alongside Component tests.\n\n![Screenshot of testing widget, expanded, showing Visual tests](../../_assets/writing-tests/test-widget-expanded-with-vta.png)\n\nOther addons, such as [a11y](../accessibility-testing.mdx#run-accessibility-tests), may also provide test types that can be run from the testing widget and affect the status indicators on stories and components.\n\n</Callout>\n\nTo run tests for a specific story or group of stories, press the menu button (three dots) that appears on hover of a sidebar item. You can then select the test type you want to run.\n\n![Screenshot of story sidebar item with open menu](../../_assets/writing-tests/context-menu.png)\n\nAfter running your tests, you will now see status indicators on stories and components for their pass, fail, or error state. You can press on the menu button when hovering a story to see the test results for that story. Selecting a result in the menu will navigate you to that story and open the appropriate debugging panel. For example, if an interaction test fails, you can jump straight to the failure in the Interactions panel. That panel provides an interactive debugger for your test, allowing you to step through each simulated behavior or assertion.\n\nThe testing widget will also show you the total number of tests run, the number of tests that passed, and the number of tests that failed or errored. You can press the failure number to filter the sidebar to only those stories that failed.\n\n<Video src=\"../../_assets/writing-tests/addon-vitest-filter-failures.mp4\" />",

To enable this, provide the [`storybookScript` option](#storybookscript) in the plugin configuration. When you run Vitest in watch mode, the plugin will start Storybook using this script and provide links to the story in the output on test failures. This allows you to quickly jump to the story in Storybook to debug the issue.\n\nYou can also provide a [`storybookUrl` option](#storybookurl) to the plugin configuration. When you're not using watch mode and tests fail, the plugin will provide a link to the story using this URL in the output. This is useful when [running tests in CI](#in-ci) or other environments where Storybook is not already running.\n\n![Screenshot of test failure in the console, showing a failure with a link to the story](../../_assets/writing-tests/vitest-plugin-test-failure.png)"

It also configures Vitest to run those tests in [browser mode](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/), using Playwright's Chromium browser. Because it is built on top of Vitest, the addon requires a Vite-based Storybook framework.\n\nStories are tested in two ways: a smoke test to ensure it renders and, if a [play function](../interaction-testing.mdx#writing-interaction-tests) is defined, that function is run and any [assertions made](../interaction-testing.mdx#asserting-with-expect) within it are validated.\n\nWhen you run tests in the [Storybook UI](#storybook-ui), the addon runs Vitest in the background and reports the results in the sidebar.

Some test types, like [visual tests](../visual-testing.mdx), are run independently. Others, like [accessibility](../accessibility-testing.mdx), must be run alongside component tests. For these dependent test types, you can toggle them on or off in the testing widget by checking or unchecking the test types you want to run.\n\n![Screenshot of testing widget, expanded, everything is checked](../../_assets/writing-tests/test-widget-expanded-all-enabled.png)\n\nNote that you may not have all of the test types pictured, depending on which addons you have installed.",
                  "Including, excluding, or skipping tests": "You can use [tags](../../writing-stories/tags.mdx) to include, exclude, or skip stories from being tested. Included stories are tested, excluded stories are not tested, and skipped stories are not tested but are counted in the test results.\n\nBy default, the plugin will run all stories with the `test` tag. You can adjust this behavior by providing the [`tags` option](#tags) in the plugin configuration. This allows you to include, exclude, or skip stories based on their tags.\n\nIn this example, we'll apply the `stable` tag to all of the Button component's stories, except for ExperimentalFeatureStory, which will have the `experimental` tag:\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-start */}\n\n<CodeSnippets path=\"tags-remove-in-story.md\" />\n\n{/* prettier-ignore-end */}\n\nTo connect those tags to our test behavior, we can adjust the plugin configuration to exclude the `experimental` tag:\n\n```\nexport default defineWorkspace([\n  // ...\n  {\n    // ...\n    {\n      plugins: [\n        storybookTest({\n          // ...\n          tags: {\n            include: ['test'],\n            exclude: ['experimental'],\n          },\n        }),\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n])\n```\n\nIf the same tag is in both the `include` and `exclude` arrays, the `exclude` behavior takes precedence."
                },
                "Comparison to the test runner": "The [test runner](./test-runner.mdx) requires a running Storybook instance to test your stories, because it visits each one, executes the play function, and listens for results. The Vitest plugin, however, transforms your stories into tests using Vite and portable stories, so it does not need to run Storybook to test your stories. Because of this reliance on Vite, the plugin can only be used with Storybook frameworks that use Vite (and [Next.js](../../get-started/frameworks/nextjs.mdx#with-vite)). The test runner, on the other hand, can be used with any Storybook framework.\n\n| Feature                                               | Vitest addon       | test-runner              |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| **Test types**                                                                                        |\n| - [Interaction tests](../interaction-testing.mdx)     | ✅                 | ✅                       |\n| - [Accessibility tests](../accessibility-testing.mdx) | ✅                 | ✅                       |\n| - [Visual tests](../visual-testing.mdx)               | ✅                 | ❌                       |\n| - [Snapshot tests](../snapshot-testing.mdx)           | ❌                 | ✅                       |\n| **Testing contexts**                                                                                  |\n| - Storybook UI                                        | ✅                 | ❌                       |\n| - Editor extensions                                   | ✅                 | ❌                       |\n| - CLI                                                 | ✅                 | ✅                       |\n| - In CI                                               | ✅                 | ✅                       |\n| Works with all Storybook frameworks                   | ❌ (requires Vite) | ✅                       |\n| Runs tests in a real browser environment              | ✅                 | ✅                       |\n| Calculates code coverage                              | ✅                 | ✅ (with addon-coverage) |\n| Requires a running or published Storybook             | ❌                 | ✅                       |\n| Extensible to other addons                            | ✅                 | ❌                       |\n\nThe test runner is only a CLI tool. It does not have a UI for running tests, nor does it have an editor extension. The addon, however, provides a UI in Storybook for running tests, and it enables you to run and debug tests using Vitest IDE integrations.\n\nAdditionally, the test runner ran your stories as orchestrated tests in Jest, and that orchestration came with some complexity. By comparison, this plugin transforms your stories into real tests and then runs them using Vitest, which is simpler and more configurable.\n\nFinally, because of the simpler architecture and the use of Vitest, this plugin should be faster than the test runner for most projects. We'll do more benchmarking to quantify this in the future.",
                "FAQ": {
                  "What happens if Vitest itself has an error?": "Sometimes tests can fail because of errors within Vitest itself. When this happens, the testing widget in the Storybook UI will alert you to the error, and you can click a link to view it in full. The error will also be logged to the console.\n\n![Screenshot of testing widget, expanded, showing Vitest error](../../_assets/writing-tests/test-widget-vitest-error.png)\n\nVitest offers [troubleshooting help for common errors](https://vitest.dev/guide/common-errors.html).",
                  "What happens when there are different test results in multiple environments?": "When you run tests with this addon, they are run as Vitest tests with whatever configuration you have set up in your project. By default, they will run in browser mode, using Playwright's Chromium browser. Sometimes, tests will fail when run in the addon (or via CLI), but then pass when viewed in the Interactions panel (or vice versa). This can happen because the tests are run in different environments, which can have different behaviors.",
                  "How do I debug my CLI tests in Storybook?": "The plugin will attempt to provide links to the story in Storybook when tests fail in CLI, for [debugging](#debugging) purposes.\n\nIf the URLs are not working when running tests in watch mode, you should check two configuration options:\n\n[\"[`storybookUrl`](#storybookurl): Ensure this URL is correct and accessible. For example, the default is `http://localhost:6006`, which may not use the same port number you're using.\", '[`storybookScript`](#storybookscript): Ensure this script is correctly starting Storybook.']\n\nIf the URLs are not working when running tests in CI, you should ensure the Storybook is built and published before running the tests. You can then provide the URL to the published Storybook using the `storybookUrl` option. See the [In CI](#in-ci) section for an example.",
                  "How do I ensure my tests can find assets in the public directory?": "If your stories use assets in the public directory and you're not using the default public directory location (`public`), you need to adjust the Vitest configuration to include the public directory. You can do this by providing the [`publicDir` option in the Vitest configuration file](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#publicdir).",
                  "How do I isolate Storybook tests from others?": "Some projects might contain a `test` property in their Vite configuration. Because the Vitest configuration used by this plugin extends that Vite config, the `test` properties are merged. This lack of isolation can cause issues with your Storybook tests.\n\nTo isolate your Storybook tests from other tests, you need to move the `test` property from your Vite configuration to the Vitest configuration. The Vitest config used by the plugin can then safely extend your Vite config without merging the `test` property.\n\nAdditionally, we recommend using a [workspace file](#example-configuration-files) to define separate projects for your Storybook tests and other tests. This ensures each can be run either in isolation or together, depending on your needs.",
                  "Why do we recommend browser mode?": "Vitest's browser mode runs your tests in a real browser (Chromium, via Playwright, in the default configuration). The alternative is a simulated browser environment, like JSDom or HappyDom, which can have differences in behavior compared to a real browser. For UI components, which can often depend on browser APIs or features, running tests in a real browser is more accurate.\n\nFor more, see [Vitest's guide on using browser mode effectively](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/#motivation).",
                  "How do I use WebDriver instead of Playwright?": "We recommend running tests in a browser using Playwright, but you can use WebDriverIO instead. To do so, you need to adjust the [browser provider in the Vitest configuration file](https://vitest.dev/config/#browser-provider).",
                  "How do I use a browser other than Chromium?": "We recommend using Chromium, because it is most likely to best match the experience of a majority of your users. However, you can use other browsers by adjusting the [browser name in the Vitest configuration file](https://vitest.dev/config/#browser-name). Note that [Playwright and WebDriverIO support different browsers](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/#browser-option-types).",
                  "How do I customize a test name?": "By default, the export name of a story is mapped to the test name.

To work around the issue, you can provide an alias to ensure the correct React version is used. Here's an example of how to do that in the Vitest configuration file:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // ...\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      \"@storybook/react-dom-shim\": \"@storybook/react-dom-shim/dist/react-16\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n</If>",

Here are steps to troubleshoot:\n\n['Check the complete error logs for additional context, particularly around story transformation', 'Pay attention to Vite dependency optimization warnings (e.g., \"new dependencies optimized: lodash\")', 'If you see dependency optimization warnings, these can cause test-breaking reloads during execution']\n\nThe most common fix is to pre-optimize your dependencies. You can do this by adding the dependencies to your Vite config's [`optimizeDeps.include`](https://vitejs.dev/config/dep-optimization-options.html#optimizedeps-include) array.\n\nThis prevents mid-test dependency optimization, which can interfere with Vitest's test suite management."
