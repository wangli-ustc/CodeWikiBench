        "Writing and contributing": "We welcome any contributions to the documentation. Contributions must [follow\nthe same process as code contributions](https://trino.io/development/) and\ncan be part of your code contributions or separate documentation improvements.\n\nThe documentation follows the Google developer documentation style guide for any\nnew documentation:\n\n['[Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)', '[Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights)', '[Word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list)', '[Style and tone](https://developers.google.com/style/tone)', '[Writing for a global audience](https://developers.google.com/style/translation)', '[Cross-references](https://developers.google.com/style/cross-references)', '[Present tense](https://developers.google.com/style/tense)']\n\nThe Google guidelines include more material than listed here, and are used as a\nguide that enable easy decision-making about proposed doc changes. Changes to\nexisting documentation to follow these guidelines are underway.\n\nAs a specific style note, because different readers may perceive the phrases \"a\nSQL\" or \"an SQL\" to be incorrect depending on how they pronounce SQL, aim to\navoid use of \"a/an SQL\" in Trino documentation. Try to reword, re-order, or\nadjust writing so that it is not necessary. If there is absolutely no way around\nit, default to using \"a SQL.\"\n\nOther useful resources:\n\n['[Style check](#style-check)', '[Google Technical Writing Courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing)', '[Myst guide](https://mystmd.org/guide)']",
        "Tools": "Documentation source files can be found in [Myst Markdown](https://mystmd.org/)\n(`.md`) format in `src/main/sphinx` and sub-folders. Refer to the [Myst\nguide](https://mystmd.org/guide) and the existing documentation for more\ninformation about how to write and format the documentation source.\n\nThe engine used to create the documentation in HTML format is the Python-based\n[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org).\n\nThe [fast doc build option](#fast-doc-build-option) requires *only* a local\ninstallation of [Docker Desktop on\nMac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [Docker Engine on\nLinux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). No other tools are required.\n\nThe default formal build of the docs is performed with Apache Maven, which requires an\ninstallation of a Java Development Kit.",
        "Fast doc build option": "For fast local build times when writing documentation, you can run the Sphinx\nbuild directly. The build runs inside a Docker container and thus does not\nrequire having anything installed locally other than Docker. You can run the\nSphinx build on a fresh clone of the project, with no prerequisite commands. For\nexample:\n\n```\ndocs/build\n```\n\nSphinx attempts to perform an incremental build, but this does not work\nin all cases, such as after editing the CSS. You can force a full rebuild\nby removing the ``target/html`` directory:\n\n```\nrm -rf docs/target/html\n```",
        "Default build": "The default build uses Apache Maven and Java as does the rest of the\nTrino build. You only need to have built the current Trino version from the root.\nThat is, before building the docs the first time, run the following command:\n\n```\n./mvnw clean install -DskipTests\n```\n\nSubsequently, you can build the doc site using the Maven wrapper script:\n\n```\n./mvnw -pl docs clean install\n```\n\nIf you have Maven installed and available on the path, you can use the `mvn` command\ndirectly.\n\nThis also performs other checks, and is the authoritative way to build the\ndocs. However, using Maven is also somewhat slower than using Sphinx directly.",
        "Viewing documentation": "However you build the docs, the generated HTML files can be found in the folder\n`docs/target/html/`.\n\nYou can open the file `docs/target/html/index.html` in a web browser on\nmacOS with\n\n```\nopen docs/target/html/index.html\n```\n\nor on Linux with\n\n```\nxdg-open docs/target/html/index.html\n```\n\nOr you can directly call your browser of choice with the same filename. For example, on Ubuntu\nwith Chromium:\n\n```\nchromium-browser docs/target/html/index.html\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can start a web server with that folder as root, such as with\nthe following Python command. You can then open\n[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in a web browser.\n\n```\ncd docs/target/html/\npython3 -m http.server 4000\n```\n\nIn order to see any changes from the source files in the HTML output, simply\nre-run the ``build`` command and refresh the browser.",
        "Versioning": "The version displayed in the resulting HTML is read by default from the top level Maven\n`pom.xml` file `version` field.\n\nTo deploy a specific documentation set (such as a SNAPSHOT version) as the release\nversion you must override the pom version with the `TRINO_VERSION`\nenvironment variable.\n\n```\nTRINO_VERSION=355 docs/build\n```\n\nIf you work on the docs for more than one invocation, you can export the\nvariable and use it with Sphinx.\n\n```\nexport TRINO_VERSION=354\ndocs/build\n```\n\nThis is especially useful when deploying doc patches for a release where the\nMaven pom has already moved to the next SNAPSHOT version.",
        "Style check": "The project contains a configured setup for [Vale](https://vale.sh) and the\nGoogle developer documentation style. Vale is a command-line tool to check for\neditorial style issues of a document or a set of documents.\n\nInstall vale with brew on macOS or follow the instructions on the website.\n\n```\nbrew install vale\n```\n\nThe `docs` folder contains the necessary configuration to use vale for any\ndocument in the repository:\n\n['`.vale` directory with Google style setup', '`.vale/Vocab/Base/accept.txt` file for additional approved words and spelling', '`.vale.ini` configuration file configured for rst and md files']\n\nWith this setup you can validate an individual file from the root by specifying\nthe path:\n\n```\nvale src/main/sphinx/overview/use-cases.md\n```\n\nYou can also use directory paths and all files within.\n\nTreat all output from vale as another help towards better docs. Fixing any\nissues is not required, but can help with learning more about the [Google style\nguide](https://developers.google.com/style) that we try to follow.",
        "Contribution requirements": "To contribute corrections or new explanations to the Trino documentation requires\nonly a willingness to help and submission of your [Contributor License\nAgreement](https://github.com/trinodb/cla) (CLA).",
        "Workflow": "The procedure to add a documentation contribution is the same as for [a code\ncontribution](https://trino.io/development/process.html).\n\n[\"In the Trino project's [GitHub Issues\\nlist](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues), identify documentation issues\\nby filtering on the [``docs``\\nlabel](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocs).\", \"If you want to help Trino documentation, but don't know where to start, look\\nin the Issues list for both the [``docs`` and ``good first issue``\\nlabels](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocs+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\", 'If the doc fix you have in mind does not yet have an issue, add one (which\\nrequires a signed CLA). Add the ``docs`` label to your new issue.', 'You can discuss proposed doc changes in the #docs channel of the [Trino\\nSlack](https://trino.io/slack.html).', 'For a larger contribution, create a GitHub pull request as described\\nin [GitHub\\ndocumentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github).\\nIn brief, this means:', ['[Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) of the\\n[trinodb/trino](https://github.com/trinodb/trino) repository.', 'Create a working branch in your fork.', 'Make your edits in your working branch and push them to your fork.', 'In a browser, open your fork in GitHub, which offers to submit a pull\\nrequest for you.']]",

          "See [**Contributing to the Trino\ndocumentation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yseFM3ZI2ro) for a\nfive-minute video introduction. Note that this video uses the old RST source\nformat.",
          "You might select a GitHub doc issue to work on that requires you to verify\nhow Trino handles a situation, such as [adding\ndocumentation](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/7660) for SQL\nfunctions.",
          "In this case, the five-minute video [Learning Trino SQL with\nDocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y58sb9bW2mA) gives you a starting\npoint for setting up a test system on your laptop."
        ],
        "Docker container": "The build of the docs uses a Docker container that includes Sphinx and the\nrequired libraries. The container is referenced in the `SPHINX_IMAGE` variable\nin the `build` script.\n\nThe specific details for the container are available in `Dockerfile`, and\n`requirements.in`. The file `requirements.txt` must be updated after any changes\nto `requirements.in`.\n\nThe container must be published to the GitHub container registry at ghcr.io with\nthe necessary access credentials and the following command, after modification\nof the version tag `xxx` to the new desired value as used in the `build` script:\n\n```\ndocker buildx build docs --platform=linux/arm64,linux/amd64 --tag ghcr.io/trinodb/build/sphinx:xxx --provenance=false --push\n```\n\nNote that the version must be updated and the command automatically also\npublishes the container with support for arm64 and amd64 processors. This is\nnecessary so the build performs well on both hardware platforms.\n\nAfter the container is published, you can update the `build` script and merge\nthe related pull request.\n\nExample PRs:\n\n['https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/17778', 'https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/13225']"

                    "Glossary": "The glossary contains a list of key Trino terms and definitions.\n\n(glosscatalog)=\nCatalog\n\n: Catalogs define and name a configuration for connecting to a data source,\nallowing users to query the connected data. Each catalog's configuration\nspecifies a {ref}`connector <glossConnector>` to define which data source\nthe catalog connects to. For more information about catalogs, see\n{ref}`trino-concept-catalog`.\n\n(glosscert)=\nCertificate\n\n: A public key [certificate](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) issued by a {ref}`CA\n<glossCA>`, sometimes abbreviated as cert, that verifies the ownership of a\nserver's private keys. Certificate format is specified in the [X.509](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) standard.\n\n(glossca)=\nCertificate Authority (CA)\n\n: A trusted organization that signs and issues certificates. Its signatures\ncan be used to verify the validity of {ref}`certificates <glossCert>`.\n\nCluster\n\n: A Trino cluster provides the resources to run queries against numerous data\nsources. Clusters define the number of nodes, the configuration for the JVM\nruntime, configured data sources, and others aspects. For more information,\nsee {ref}`trino-concept-cluster`.\n\n(glossconnector)=\nConnector\n\n: Translates data from a data source into Trino schemas, tables, columns,\nrows, and data types. A {doc}`connector </connector>` is specific to a data\nsource, and is used in {ref}`catalog <glossCatalog>` configurations to\ndefine what data source the catalog connects to. A connector is one of many\ntypes of {ref}`plugins <glossPlugin>`\n\n(glosscontainer)=\nContainer\n\n: A lightweight virtual package of software that contains libraries, binaries,\ncode, configuration files, and other dependencies needed to deploy an\napplication. A running container does not include an operating system,\ninstead using the operating system of the host machine. To learn more, \nread about [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/)\nin the Kubernetes documentation.\n\n(glossdatasource)=\nData source\n\n: A system from which data is retrieved - for example, PostgreSQL or Iceberg\non S3 data. In Trino, users query data sources with {ref}`catalogs\n<glossCatalog>` that connect to each source. See\n{ref}`trino-concept-data-source` for more information.\n\n(glossdatavirtualization)=\nData virtualization\n\n: [Data virtualization](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_virtualization) is a\nmethod of abstracting an interaction with multiple {ref}`heterogeneous data\nsources <glossDataSource>`, without needing to know the distributed nature\nof the data, its format, or any other technical details involved in\npresenting the data.\n\n(glossgzip)=\ngzip\n\n: [gzip](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) is a compression format and\nsoftware that compresses and decompresses files. This format is used several\nways in Trino, including deployment and compressing files in {ref}`object\nstorage <glossObjectStorage>`. The most common extension for gzip-compressed\nfiles is `.gz`.\n\n(glosshdfs)=\nHDFS\n\n: [Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop#HDFS) is a scalable {ref}`open\nsource <glossOpenSource>` filesystem that was one of the earliest\ndistributed big data systems created to store large amounts of data for the\n[Hadoop ecosystem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop).\n\n(glossjks)=\nJava KeyStore (JKS)\n\n: The system of public key cryptography supported as one part of the Java\nsecurity APIs. The legacy JKS system recognizes keys and {ref}`certificates\n<glossCert>` stored in *keystore* files, typically with the `.jks`\nextension, and by default relies on a system-level list of {ref}`CAs\n<glossCA>` in *truststore* files installed as part of the current Java\ninstallation.\n\nKey\n\n: A cryptographic key specified as a pair of public and private strings\ngenerally used in the context of {ref}`TLS <glossTLS>` to secure public\nnetwork traffic.\n\n(glosslb)=\nLoad Balancer (LB)\n\n: Software or a hardware device that sits on a network edge and accepts\nnetwork connections on behalf of servers behind that wall, distributing\ntraffic across network and server infrastructure to balance the load on\nnetworked services.\n\n(glossobjectstorage)=\nObject storage\n\n: [Object storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage) is a file\nstorage mechanism. Examples of compatible object stores include the\nfollowing:\n\n['[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)', '[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)', '[Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs)', '[MinIO](https://min.io/) and other S3-compatible stores', '{ref}`HDFS <glossHDFS>`']\n\n(glossopensource)=\nOpen-source\n\n: Typically refers to [open-source software](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). which is software that\nhas the source code made available for others to see, use, and contribute\nto. Allowed usage varies depending on the license that the software is\nlicensed under. Trino is licensed under the [Apache license](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License), and is therefore maintained\nby a community of contributors from all across the globe.\n\n(glosspem)=\nPEM file format\n\n: A format for storing and sending cryptographic keys and certificates. PEM\nformat can contain both a key and its certificate, plus the chain of\ncertificates from authorities back to the root {ref}`CA <glossCA>`, or back\nto a CA vendor's intermediate CA.\n\n(glosspkcs12)=\nPKCS #12\n\n: A binary archive used to store keys and certificates or certificate chains\nthat validate a key. [PKCS #12](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) files\nhave `.p12` or `.pfx` extensions. This format is a less popular\nalternative to {ref}`PEM <glossPEM>`.\n\n(glossplugin)=\nPlugin\n\n: A bundle of code implementing the Trino [Service Provider Interface\n(SPI)](/develop/spi-overview). that is used to add new functionality.\nMore information is available in [](/installation/plugins).\n\nPresto and PrestoSQL\n\n: The old name for Trino. To learn more about the name change to Trino, read\n[the history](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Trino_(SQL_query_engine)#History>).\n\nQuery federation\n\n: A type of {ref}`data virtualization <glossDataVirtualization>` that provides a\ncommon access point and data model across two or more heterogeneous data\nsources. A popular data model used by many query federation engines is\ntranslating different data sources to {ref}`SQL <glossSQL>` tables.\n\n(glossssl)=\nSecure Sockets Layer (SSL)\n\n: Now superseded by {ref}`TLS <glossTLS>`, but still recognized as the term\nfor what TLS does.\n\n(glosssql)=\nStructured Query Language (SQL)\n\n: The standard language used with relational databases. For more information,\nsee {doc}`SQL </language>`.\n\n(glosstarball)=\nTarball\n\n: A common abbreviation for [TAR file](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)>), which is a common software\ndistribution mechanism. This file format is a collection of multiple files\ndistributed as a single file, commonly compressed using {ref}`gzip\n<glossGzip>` compression.\n\n(glosstls)=\nTransport Layer Security (TLS)\n\n: [TLS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is a security\nprotocol designed to provide secure communications over a network. It is the\nsuccessor to {ref}`SSL <glossSSL>`, and used in many applications like\nHTTPS, email, and Trino. These security topics use the term TLS to refer to\nboth TLS and SSL."

inner and right joins with `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` or\\n`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` join conditions, and\\nsemi-joins with `IN` conditions are supported.', 'Connector support for utilizing dynamic filters pushed into the table scan at runtime.\\nFor example, the Hive connector can push dynamic filters into ORC and Parquet readers\\nto perform stripe or row-group pruning.', 'Connector support for utilizing dynamic filters at the splits enumeration stage.', 'Size of right (build) side of the join.']\n\nYou can take a closer look at the {doc}`EXPLAIN plan </sql/explain>` of the query\nto analyze if the planner is adding dynamic filters to a specific query's plan.\nFor example, the explain plan for the above query can be obtained by running\nthe following statement:\n\n```\nEXPLAIN\nSELECT count(*)\nFROM store_sales\nJOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\nWHERE d_following_holiday='Y' AND d_year = 2000;\n```\n\nThe explain plan for this query shows `dynamicFilterAssignments` in the\n`InnerJoin` node with dynamic filter `df_370` collected from build symbol `d_date_sk`.\nYou can also see the `dynamicFilter` predicate as part of the Hive `ScanFilterProject`\noperator where `df_370` is associated with probe symbol `ss_sold_date_sk`.\nThis shows you that the planner is successful in pushing dynamic filters\ndown to the connector in the query plan.\n\n```\n...\n\nFragment 1 [SOURCE]\n    Output layout: [count_3]\n    Output partitioning: SINGLE []\n    Aggregate(PARTIAL)\n    │   Layout: [count_3:bigint]\n    │

                        "Dynamic filter collection thresholds": "In order for dynamic filtering to work, the smaller dimension table\nneeds to be chosen as a join’s build side. The cost-based optimizer can automatically\ndo this using table statistics provided by connectors. Therefore, it is recommended\nto keep {doc}`table statistics </optimizer/statistics>` up to date and rely on the\nCBO to correctly choose the smaller table on the build side of join.\n\nCollection of values of the join key columns from the build side for\ndynamic filtering may incur additional CPU overhead during query execution.\nTherefore, to limit the overhead of collecting dynamic filters\nto the cases where the join operator is likely to be selective,\nTrino defines thresholds on the size of dynamic filters collected from build side tasks.\nCollection of dynamic filters for joins with large build sides can be enabled\nusing the `enable-large-dynamic-filters` configuration property or the\n`enable_large_dynamic_filters` session property.\n\nWhen large dynamic filters are enabled, limits on the size of dynamic filters can\nbe configured using the configuration properties\n`dynamic-filtering.large.max-distinct-values-per-driver`,\n`dynamic-filtering.large.max-size-per-driver` ,\n`dynamic-filtering.large.range-row-limit-per-driver`,\n`dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-distinct-values-per-driver`,\n`dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-size-per-driver` and\n`dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.range-row-limit-per-driver`.\n\nSimilarly, limits for dynamic filters when `enable-large-dynamic-filters`\nis not enabled can be configured using configuration properties like\n`dynamic-filtering.small.max-distinct-values-per-driver`,\n`dynamic-filtering.small.max-size-per-driver` ,\n`dynamic-filtering.small.range-row-limit-per-driver`,\n`dynamic-filtering.small-partitioned.max-distinct-values-per-driver`,\n`dynamic-filtering.small-partitioned.max-size-per-driver` and\n`dynamic-filtering.small-partitioned.range-row-limit-per-driver`.\n\nThe `dynamic-filtering.large.*` and `dynamic-filtering.small.*` limits are applied\nwhen dynamic filters are collected before build side is partitioned on join\nkeys (when broadcast join is chosen or when fault-tolerant execution is enabled). The\n`dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.*` and `dynamic-filtering.small-partitioned.*`\nlimits are applied when dynamic filters are collected after build side is partitioned\non join keys (when partitioned join is chosen and fault-tolerant execution is disabled).\n\nThe properties based on `max-distinct-values-per-driver` and `max-size-per-driver`\ndefine thresholds for the size up to which dynamic filters are collected in a\ndistinct values data structure. When the build side exceeds these thresholds,\nTrino switches to collecting min and max values per column to reduce overhead.\nThis min-max filter has much lower granularity than the distinct values filter.\nHowever, it may still be beneficial in filtering some data from the probe side,\nespecially when a range of values is selected from the build side of the join.\nThe limits for min-max filters collection are defined by the properties\nbased on `range-row-limit-per-driver`.",

The endpoint must be\navailable at the URL configured with `server_ip` and `server_port` and is\nassumed to be stable.\n\nYou can use an application such as [fluentbit](https://fluentbit.io/) as a\nconsumer for these JSON-formatted logs. \n\nExample fluentbit configuration file `config.yaml`:\n\n```\npipeline:\n  inputs:\n  - name: tcp\n    tag: trino\n    listen: 0.0.0.0\n    port: 5170\n    buffer_size: 2048\n    format: json\n  outputs:\n  - name: stdout\n    match: '*'\n```\n\nStart the application with the command:\n\n```\nfluent-bit -c config.yaml\n```\n\nUse the following Trino properties configuration:\n\n```\nlog.path=tcp://localhost:5170\nlog.format=json\nnode.annotation-file=etc/annotations.properties\n```\n\nFile `etc/annotation.properties`:\n\n```\nhost_ip=1.2.3.4\nservice_name=trino\npod_name=${ENV:HOSTNAME}\n```\n\nAs a result, Trino logs appear as structured JSON log lines in fluentbit in the\nuser interface, and can also be [forwarded into a configured logging\nsystem](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs)."

The goal of this mechanism is to\nenable execution of queries that require amounts of memory exceeding per query\nor per node limits.\n\nThe mechanism is similar to OS level page swapping. However, it is\nimplemented on the application level to address specific needs of Trino.\n\nProperties related to spilling are described in {doc}`properties-spilling`.\n\n:::{warning} \nThe spill to disk feature and implementation are a legacy functionality of\nTrino. Consider using [](/admin/fault-tolerant-execution) with the `task` retry\npolicy and a configured [](fte-exchange-manager).\n:::",
                        "Memory management and spill": "By default, Trino kills queries, if the memory requested by the query execution\nexceeds session properties `query_max_memory` or\n`query_max_memory_per_node`. This mechanism ensures fairness in allocation\nof memory to queries, and prevents deadlock caused by memory allocation.\nIt is efficient when there is a lot of small queries in the cluster, but\nleads to killing large queries that don't stay within the limits.\n\nTo overcome this inefficiency, the concept of revocable memory was introduced. A\nquery can request memory that does not count toward the limits, but this memory\ncan be revoked by the memory manager at any time. When memory is revoked, the\nquery runner spills intermediate data from memory to disk and continues to\nprocess it later.\n\nIn practice, when the cluster is idle, and all memory is available, a memory\nintensive query may use all the memory in the cluster. On the other hand,\nwhen the cluster does not have much free memory, the same query may be forced to\nuse disk as storage for intermediate data. A query, that is forced to spill to\ndisk, may have a longer execution time by orders of magnitude than a query that\nruns completely in memory.\n\nPlease note that enabling spill-to-disk does not guarantee execution of all\nmemory intensive queries. It is still possible that the query runner fails\nto divide intermediate data into chunks small enough so that every chunk fits into\nmemory, leading to `Out of memory` errors while loading the data from disk.",
                        "Spill disk space": "Spilling intermediate results to disk, and retrieving them back, is expensive\nin terms of IO operations. Thus, queries that use spill likely become\nthrottled by disk. To increase query performance, it is recommended to\nprovide multiple paths on separate local devices for spill (property\n`spiller-spill-path` in {doc}`properties-spilling`).\n\nThe system drive should not be used for spilling, especially not to the drive where the JVM\nis running and writing logs. Doing so may lead to cluster instability. Additionally,\nit is recommended to monitor the disk saturation of the configured spill paths.\n\nTrino treats spill paths as independent disks (see [JBOD](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-RAID_drive_architectures#JBOD)), so\nthere is no need to use RAID for spill.",
                        "Spill compression": "When spill compression is enabled with the [`spill-compression-codec`\nproperty](/admin/properties-spilling), spilled pages are compressed, before\nbeing written to disk. Enabling this feature can reduce disk IO at the cost of\nextra CPU load to compress and decompress spilled pages.",
                        "Spill encryption": "When spill encryption is enabled (`spill-encryption-enabled` property in\n{doc}`properties-spilling`), spill contents are encrypted with a randomly generated\n(per spill file) secret key. Enabling this increases CPU load and reduces throughput\nof spilling to disk, but can protect spilled data from being recovered from spill files.\nConsider reducing the value of `memory-revoking-threshold` when spill\nencryption is enabled, to account for the increase in latency of spilling.",

                          "Joins": "During the join operation, one of the tables being joined is stored in memory.\nThis table is called the build table. The rows from the other table stream\nthrough and are passed onto the next operation, if they match rows in the build\ntable. The most memory-intensive part of the join is this build table.\n\nWhen the task concurrency is greater than one, the build table is partitioned.\nThe number of partitions is equal to the value of the `task.concurrency`\nconfiguration parameter (see {doc}`properties-task`).\n\nWhen the build table is partitioned, the spill-to-disk mechanism can decrease\nthe peak memory usage needed by the join operation. When a query approaches the\nmemory limit, a subset of the partitions of the build table gets spilled to disk,\nalong with rows from the other table that fall into those same partitions. The\nnumber of partitions, that get spilled, influences the amount of disk space needed.\n\nAfterward, the spilled partitions are read back one-by-one to finish the join\noperation.\n\nWith this mechanism, the peak memory used by the join operator can be decreased\nto the size of the largest build table partition. Assuming no data skew, this\nis `1 / task.concurrency` times the size of the whole build table.",

When spill to disk for window functions is enabled, if there is not enough\nmemory, intermediate results are written to disk. They are loaded back and merged\nwhen memory is available. There is a current limitation that spill does not work\nin all cases, such as when a single window is very large."

Use the experimental\nmode whenever possible. Avoid using the legacy mode. Leave Hive views support\ndisabled, if you are not accessing any Hive views from Trino.\n\nYou can configure the behavior in your catalog properties file.\n\nBy default, Hive views are executed with the `RUN AS DEFINER` security mode.\nSet the  `hive.hive-views.run-as-invoker` catalog configuration property to\n`true` to use `RUN AS INVOKER` semantics.\n\n**Disabled**\n\nThe default behavior is to ignore Hive views.

It does not do any translation, but instead relies on the\nfact that HiveQL is very similar to SQL.\n\nThis works for very simple Hive views, but can lead to problems for more complex\nqueries. For example, if a HiveQL function has an identical signature but\ndifferent behaviors to the SQL version, the returned results may differ. In more\nextreme cases the queries might fail, or not even be able to be parsed and\nexecuted.\n\n**Experimental**\n\nThe new behavior is better engineered and has the potential to become a lot\nmore powerful than the legacy implementation.

It specifies\nwhich MBeans are sampled and stored in memory every `dump-period`. You can\nconfigure the maximum number of history entries with `max-entries` and it\ndefaults to `86400`. The time between dumps can be configured using\n`dump-period` and it defaults to `10s`.\n\nCommas in MBean names must be escaped using double backslashes (`\\\\`) in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n```\nconnector.name=jmx\njmx.dump-tables=trino.memory:name=general\\\\,type=memorypool,trino.memory:name=reserved\\\\,type=memorypool\n```\n\nDouble backslashes are required because a single backslash (`\\`) is used to\nsplit the value across multiple lines in the following manner:\n\n```\nconnector.name=jmx\njmx.dump-tables=trino.memory:name=general\\\\,type=memorypool,\\\n    trino.memory:name=reserved\\\\,type=memorypool\n```",

You can see all the available MBeans by running `SHOW TABLES`:\n\n```\nSHOW TABLES FROM example.current;\n```\n\nMBean names map to non-standard table names, and must be quoted with\ndouble quotes when referencing them in a query. For example, the\nfollowing query shows the JVM version of every node:\n\n```\nSELECT node, vmname, vmversion\nFROM example.current.\"java.lang:type=runtime\";\n```\n\n```\n                 node                 |              vmname               | vmversion\n--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------\n ddc4df17-0b8e-4843-bb14-1b8af1a7451a | Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM | 24.60-b09\n(1 row)\n```\n\nThe following query shows the open and maximum file descriptor counts\nfor each node:\n\n```\nSELECT openfiledescriptorcount, maxfiledescriptorcount\nFROM example.current.\"java.lang:type=operatingsystem\";\n```\n\n```\n openfiledescriptorcount | maxfiledescriptorcount\n-------------------------+------------------------\n                     329 |                  10240\n(1 row)\n```\n\nThe wildcard character `*` may be used with table names in the `current` schema.\nThis allows matching several MBean objects within a single query. The following query\nreturns information from the different Trino memory pools on each node:\n\n```\nSELECT freebytes, node, object_name\nFROM example.current.\"trino.memory:*type=memorypool*\";\n```\n\n```\n freebytes  |  node   |                       object_name\n------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------\n  214748364 | example | trino.memory:type=MemoryPool,name=reserved\n 1073741825 | example | trino.memory:type=MemoryPool,name=general\n  858993459 | example | trino.memory:type=MemoryPool,name=system\n(3 rows)\n```\n\nThe `history` schema contains the list of tables configured in the connector properties file.\nThe tables have the same columns as those in the current schema, but with an additional\ntimestamp column that stores the time at which the snapshot was taken:\n\n```\nSELECT \"timestamp\", \"uptime\" FROM example.history.\"java.lang:type=runtime\";\n```\n\n```\n        timestamp        | uptime\n-------------------------+--------\n 2016-01-28 10:18:50.000 |  11420\n 2016-01-28 10:19:00.000 |  21422\n 2016-01-28 10:19:10.000 |  31412\n(3 rows)\n```\n\n(jmx-sql-support)=",

Trino does not generate those codes by itself, but those can be\ngenerated by load balancers in front of Trino. \n\nAdditionally, if the request returns a 429 status code, the client should \nretry the request using the `Retry-After` header value provided. \n\nAny HTTP status other than 502, 503, 504 or 200 means that query processing \nhas failed.\n\nThe `/v1/statement` `POST` request returns a JSON document of type\n`QueryResults`, as well as a collection of response headers.

The `columns` field is set to a list of the names and types of the\ncolumns returned by the query. Most of the response headers are treated like\nbrowser cookies by the client, and echoed back as request headers in subsequent\nclient requests, as documented below.\n\nIf the JSON document returned by the `POST` to `/v1/statement` does not contain\na `nextUri` link, the query has completed, either successfully or\nunsuccessfully, and no additional requests need to be made. If the `nextUri`\nlink is present in the document, there are more query results to be fetched. The\nclient should loop executing a `GET` request to the `nextUri` returned in the\n`QueryResults` response object until `nextUri` is absent from the response.\n\nThe `status` field of the JSON document is for human consumption only, and\nprovides a hint about the query state.

This\nclass describes all the available properties, their types, and additional\nvalidation rules.\n\n```\nimport io.airlift.configuration.Config;\nimport io.airlift.configuration.ConfigDescription;\nimport io.airlift.configuration.ConfigSecuritySensitive;\nimport io.airlift.units.Duration;\nimport io.airlift.units.MaxDuration;\nimport io.airlift.units.MinDuration;\n\nimport javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;\n\npublic class ExampleConfig\n{\n    private String secret;\n    private Duration timeout = Duration.succinctDuration(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n\n    public String getSecret()\n    {\n        return secret;\n    }\n\n    @Config(\"secret\")\n    @ConfigDescription(\"Secret required to access the data source\")\n    @ConfigSecuritySensitive\n    public ExampleConfig setSecret(String secret)\n    {\n        this.secret = secret;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    @NotNull\n    @MaxDuration(\"10m\")\n    @MinDuration(\"1ms\")\n    public Duration getTimeout()\n    {\n        return timeout;\n    }\n\n    @Config(\"timeout\")\n    public ExampleConfig setTimeout(Duration timeout)\n    {\n        this.timeout = timeout;\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe preceding example defines two configuration properties and makes\nthe connector more robust by:\n\n['defining all supported properties, which allows detecting spelling mistakes\\nin the configuration on server startup', 'defining a default timeout value, to prevent connections getting stuck\\nindefinitely', 'preventing invalid timeout values, like 0 ms, that would make\\nall requests fail', 'parsing timeout values in different units, detecting invalid values', 'preventing logging the secret value in plain text']\n\nThe configuration class needs to be bound in a Guice module:\n\n```\nimport com.google.inject.Binder;\nimport com.google.inject.Module;\n\nimport static io.airlift.configuration.ConfigBinder.configBinder;\n\npublic class ExampleModule\n        implements Module\n{\n    public ExampleModule()\n    {\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void configure(Binder binder)\n    {\n        configBinder(binder).bindConfig(ExampleConfig.class);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then the module needs to be initialized in the connector factory, when\ncreating a new instance of the connector:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic Connector create(String connectorName, Map<String, String> config, ConnectorContext context)\n{\n    requireNonNull(config, \"config is null\");\n    Bootstrap app = new Bootstrap(new ExampleModule());\n    Injector injector = app\n            .doNotInitializeLogging()\n            .setRequiredConfigurationProperties(config)\n            .initialize();\n\n    return injector.getInstance(ExampleConnector.class);\n}\n```\n\n:::{note}\nEnvironment variables in the catalog properties file\n(ex. `secret=${ENV:SECRET}`) are resolved only when using\nthe `io.airlift.bootstrap.Bootstrap` class to initialize the module.\nSee {doc}`/security/secrets` for more information.\n:::\n\nIf you end up needing to define multiple catalogs using the same connector\njust to change one property, consider adding support for schema and/or\ntable properties. That would allow a more fine-grained configuration.\nIf a connector doesn't support managing the schema, query predicates for\nselected columns could be used as a way of passing the required configuration\nat run time.\n\nFor example, when building a connector to read commits from a Git repository,\nthe repository URL could be a configuration property. But this would result\nin a catalog being able to return data only from a single repository.\nAlternatively, it can be a column, where every select query would require\na predicate for it:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM git.default.commits\nWHERE url = 'https://github.com/trinodb/trino.git'\n```\n\n(connector-metadata)="

                          "Predicate pushdown": "When executing a query with a `WHERE` clause, the query plan can\ncontain a `ScanFilterProject` plan node/node with a predicate constraint.\n\nA predicate constraint is a description of the constraint imposed on the\nresults of the stage/fragment as expressed in the `WHERE` clause. For example,\n`WHERE x > 5 AND y = 3` translates into a constraint where the\n`summary` field means the `x` column's domain must be greater than\n`5` and the `y` column domain equals `3`.\n\nWhen the query plan contains a `ScanFilterProject` operation, Trino\ntries to optimize the query by pushing down the predicate constraint\ninto the connector by calling the `applyFilter` method of the\nconnector metadata service. This method receives a table handle with\nall optimizations applied thus far, and returns either\n`Optional.empty()` or a response with a new table handle derived from\nthe old one.\n\nThe query optimizer may call `applyFilter` for a single query multiple times,\nas it searches for an optimal query plan. Connectors must\nreturn `Optional.empty()` from `applyFilter` if they cannot apply the\nconstraint for this invocation, even if they support `ScanFilterProject`\npushdown in general. Connectors must also return `Optional.empty()` if the\nconstraint has already been applied.\n\nA constraint contains the following elements:\n\n['A `TupleDomain` defining the mapping between columns and their domains.\\nA `Domain` is either a list of possible values, or a list of ranges, and\\nalso contains information about nullability.', 'Expression for pushing down function calls.', 'Map of assignments from variables in the expression to columns.', '(optional) Predicate which tests a map of columns and their values;\\nit cannot be held on to after the `applyFilter` call returns.', '(optional) Set of columns the predicate depends on; must be present\\nif predicate is present.']\n\nIf both a predicate and a summary are available, the predicate is guaranteed to\nbe more strict in filtering of values, and can provide a significant boost to\nquery performance if used.\n\nHowever it is not possible to store a predicate in the table handle and use\nit later, as the predicate cannot be held on to after the `applyFilter`\ncall returns. It is used for filtering of entire partitions, and is not pushed\ndown. The summary can be pushed down instead by storing it in the table handle.\n\nThis overlap between the predicate and summary is due to historical reasons,\nas simple comparison pushdown was implemented first via summary, and more\ncomplex filters such as `LIKE` which required more expressive predicates\nwere added later.\n\nIf a constraint can only be partially pushed down, for example when a connector\nfor a database that does not support range matching is used in a query with\n`WHERE x = 2 AND y > 5`, the `y` column constraint must be\nreturned in the `ConstraintApplicationResult` from `applyFilter`.\nIn this case the `y > 5` condition is applied in Trino,\nand not pushed down.\n\nThe following is a simple example which only looks at `TupleDomain`:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic Optional<ConstraintApplicationResult<ConnectorTableHandle>> applyFilter(\n        ConnectorSession session,\n        ConnectorTableHandle tableHandle,\n        Constraint constraint)\n{\n    ExampleTableHandle handle = (ExampleTableHandle) tableHandle;\n\n    TupleDomain<ColumnHandle> oldDomain = handle.getConstraint();\n    TupleDomain<ColumnHandle> newDomain = oldDomain.intersect(constraint.getSummary());\n    if (oldDomain.equals(newDomain)) {\n        // Nothing has changed, return empty Option\n        return Optional.empty();\n    }\n\n    handle = new ExampleTableHandle(newDomain);\n    return Optional.of(new ConstraintApplicationResult<>(handle, TupleDomain.all(), false));\n}\n```\n\nThe `TupleDomain` from the constraint is intersected with the `TupleDomain`\nalready applied to the `TableHandle` to form `newDomain`.\nIf filtering has not changed, an `Optional.empty()` result is returned to\nnotify the planner that this optimization path has reached its end.\n\nIn this example, the connector pushes down the `TupleDomain`\nwith all Trino data types supported with same semantics in the\ndata source. As a result, no filters are needed in Trino,\nand the `ConstraintApplicationResult` sets `remainingFilter` to\n`TupleDomain.all()`.\n\nThis pushdown implementation is quite similar to many Trino connectors,\nincluding  `MongoMetadata`, `BigQueryMetadata`, `KafkaMetadata`.\n\nThe following, more complex example shows data types from Trino that are\nnot available directly in the underlying data source, and must be mapped:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic Optional<ConstraintApplicationResult<ConnectorTableHandle>> applyFilter(\n        ConnectorSession session,\n        ConnectorTableHandle table,\n        Constraint constraint)\n{\n    JdbcTableHandle handle = (JdbcTableHandle) table;\n\n    TupleDomain<ColumnHandle> oldDomain = handle.getConstraint();\n    TupleDomain<ColumnHandle> newDomain = oldDomain.intersect(constraint.getSummary());\n    TupleDomain<ColumnHandle> remainingFilter;\n    if (newDomain.isNone()) {\n        newConstraintExpressions = ImmutableList.of();\n        remainingFilter = TupleDomain.all();\n        remainingExpression = Optional.of(Constant.TRUE);\n    }\n    else {\n        // We need to decide which columns to push down.\n        // Since this is a base class for many JDBC-based connectors, each\n        // having different Trino type mappings and comparison semantics\n        // it needs to be flexible.\n\n        Map<ColumnHandle, Domain> domains = newDomain.getDomains().orElseThrow();\n        List<JdbcColumnHandle> columnHandles = domains.keySet().stream()\n                .map(JdbcColumnHandle.class::cast)\n                .collect(toImmutableList());\n\n        // Get information about how to push down every column based on its\n        // JDBC data type\n        List<ColumnMapping> columnMappings = jdbcClient.toColumnMappings(\n                session,\n                columnHandles.stream()\n                        .map(JdbcColumnHandle::getJdbcTypeHandle)\n                        .collect(toImmutableList()));\n\n        // Calculate the domains which can be safely pushed down (supported)\n        // and those which need to be filtered in Trino (unsupported)\n        Map<ColumnHandle, Domain> supported = new HashMap<>();\n        Map<ColumnHandle, Domain> unsupported = new HashMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < columnHandles.size(); i++) {\n            JdbcColumnHandle column = columnHandles.get(i);\n            DomainPushdownResult pushdownResult =\n                columnMappings.get(i).getPredicatePushdownController().apply(\n                    session,\n                    domains.get(column));\n            supported.put(column, pushdownResult.getPushedDown());\n            unsupported.put(column, pushdownResult.getRemainingFilter());\n        }\n\n        newDomain = TupleDomain.withColumnDomains(supported);\n        remainingFilter = TupleDomain.withColumnDomains(unsupported);\n    }\n\n    // Return empty Optional if nothing changed in filtering\n    if (oldDomain.equals(newDomain)) {\n        return Optional.empty();\n    }\n\n    handle = new JdbcTableHandle(\n            handle.getRelationHandle(),\n            newDomain,\n            ...);\n\n    return Optional.of(\n            new ConstraintApplicationResult<>(\n                handle,\n                remainingFilter));\n}\n```\n\nThis example illustrates implementing a base class for many JDBC connectors\nwhile handling the specific requirements of multiple JDBC-compliant data sources.\nIt ensures that if a constraint gets pushed down, it works exactly the same in\nthe underlying data source, and produces the same results as it would in Trino.\nFor example, in databases where string comparisons are case-insensitive,\npushdown does not work, as string comparison operations in Trino are\ncase-sensitive.\n\nThe `PredicatePushdownController` interface determines if a column domain can\nbe pushed down in JDBC-compliant data sources. In the preceding example, it is\ncalled from a `JdbcClient` implementation specific to that database.\nIn non-JDBC-compliant data sources, type-based push downs are implemented\ndirectly, without going through the `PredicatePushdownController` interface.\n\nThe following example adds expression pushdown enabled by a session flag:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic Optional<ConstraintApplicationResult<ConnectorTableHandle>> applyFilter(\n        ConnectorSession session,\n        ConnectorTableHandle table,\n        Constraint constraint)\n{\n    JdbcTableHandle handle = (JdbcTableHandle) table;\n\n    TupleDomain<ColumnHandle> oldDomain = handle.getConstraint();\n    TupleDomain<ColumnHandle> newDomain = oldDomain.intersect(constraint.getSummary());\n    List<String> newConstraintExpressions;\n    TupleDomain<ColumnHandle> remainingFilter;\n    Optional<ConnectorExpression> remainingExpression;\n    if (newDomain.isNone()) {\n        newConstraintExpressions = ImmutableList.of();\n        remainingFilter = TupleDomain.all();\n        remainingExpression = Optional.of(Constant.TRUE);\n    }\n    else {\n        // We need to decide which columns to push down.\n        // Since this is a base class for many JDBC-based connectors, each\n        // having different Trino type mappings and comparison semantics\n        // it needs to be flexible.\n\n        Map<ColumnHandle, Domain> domains = newDomain.getDomains().orElseThrow();\n        List<JdbcColumnHandle> columnHandles = domains.keySet().stream()\n                .map(JdbcColumnHandle.class::cast)\n                .collect(toImmutableList());\n\n        // Get information about how to push down every column based on its\n        // JDBC data type\n        List<ColumnMapping> columnMappings = jdbcClient.toColumnMappings(\n                session,\n                columnHandles.stream()\n                        .map(JdbcColumnHandle::getJdbcTypeHandle)\n                        .collect(toImmutableList()));\n\n        // Calculate the domains which can be safely pushed down (supported)\n        // and those which need to be filtered in Trino (unsupported)\n        Map<ColumnHandle, Domain> supported = new HashMap<>();\n        Map<ColumnHandle, Domain> unsupported = new HashMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < columnHandles.size(); i++) {\n            JdbcColumnHandle column = columnHandles.get(i);\n            DomainPushdownResult pushdownResult =\n                columnMappings.get(i).getPredicatePushdownController().apply(\n                    session,\n                    domains.get(column));\n            supported.put(column, pushdownResult.getPushedDown());\n            unsupported.put(column, pushdownResult.getRemainingFilter());\n        }\n\n        newDomain = TupleDomain.withColumnDomains(supported);\n        remainingFilter = TupleDomain.withColumnDomains(unsupported);\n\n        // Do we want to handle expression pushdown?\n        if (isComplexExpressionPushdown(session)) {\n            List<String> newExpressions = new ArrayList<>();\n            List<ConnectorExpression> remainingExpressions = new ArrayList<>();\n            // Each expression can be broken down into a list of conjuncts\n            // joined with AND.

This can be achieved by specifying the `ESCAPE` character to\nuse:\n\n```\nSELECT 'South_America' LIKE 'South\\_America' ESCAPE '\\';\n```\n\nThe above query returns `true` since the escaped underscore symbol matches.

The preceding query is equivalent to the following query:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM region WHERE name = 'AMERICA' OR name = 'EUROPE';\n```\n\nYou can negate the comparisons by adding `NOT`, and get all other regions\nexcept the values in list:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM region WHERE name NOT IN ('AMERICA', 'EUROPE');\n```\n\nWhen using a subquery to determine the values to use in the comparison, the\nsubquery must return a single column and one or more rows.

The length parameter for `varchar` is an optional maximum length\nparameter and comparison is based on the data only, ignoring the length:\n\n```\nSELECT cast('Test' as varchar(20)) = cast('Test' as varchar(25)); --true\nSELECT cast('Test' as varchar(20)) = cast('Test   ' as varchar(25)); --false\n```\n\nThe length parameter for `char` defines a fixed length character array.\nComparison with different length automatically includes a cast to the same\nlarger length.

                        "Cast to JSON": "The following types can be cast to JSON:\n\n['`BOOLEAN`', '`TINYINT`', '`SMALLINT`', '`INTEGER`', '`BIGINT`', '`REAL`', '`DOUBLE`', '`VARCHAR`']\n\nAdditionally, `ARRAY`, `MAP`, and `ROW` types can be cast to JSON when\nthe following requirements are met:\n\n['`ARRAY` types can be cast when the element type of the array is one\\nof the supported types.', '`MAP` types can be cast when the key type of the map is `VARCHAR` and\\nthe value type of the map is a supported type,', '`ROW` types can be cast when every field type of the row is a supported\\ntype.']\n\n:::{note}\nCast operations with supported {ref}`character string types\n<string-data-types>` treat the input as a string, not validated as JSON.\nThis means that a cast operation with a string-type input of invalid JSON\nresults in a successful cast to invalid JSON.\n\nInstead, consider using the {func}`json_parse` function to\ncreate validated JSON from a string.\n:::\n\nThe following examples show the behavior of casting to JSON with these types:\n\n```\nSELECT CAST(NULL AS JSON);\n-- NULL\n\nSELECT CAST(1 AS JSON);\n-- JSON '1'\n\nSELECT CAST(9223372036854775807 AS JSON);\n-- JSON '9223372036854775807'\n\nSELECT CAST('abc' AS JSON);\n-- JSON '\"abc\"'\n\nSELECT CAST(true AS JSON);\n-- JSON 'true'\n\nSELECT CAST(1.234 AS JSON);\n-- JSON '1.234'\n\nSELECT CAST(ARRAY[1, 23, 456] AS JSON);\n-- JSON '[1,23,456]'\n\nSELECT CAST(ARRAY[1, NULL, 456] AS JSON);\n-- JSON '[1,null,456]'\n\nSELECT CAST(ARRAY[ARRAY[1, 23], ARRAY[456]] AS JSON);\n-- JSON '[[1,23],[456]]'\n\nSELECT CAST(MAP(ARRAY['k1', 'k2', 'k3'], ARRAY[1, 23, 456]) AS JSON);\n-- JSON '{\"k1\":1,\"k2\":23,\"k3\":456}'\n\nSELECT CAST(CAST(ROW(123, 'abc', true) AS\n            ROW(v1 BIGINT, v2 VARCHAR, v3 BOOLEAN)) AS JSON);\n-- JSON '{\"v1\":123,\"v2\":\"abc\",\"v3\":true}'\n```\n\nCasting from NULL to `JSON` is not straightforward. Casting\nfrom a standalone `NULL` will produce SQL `NULL` instead of\n`JSON 'null'`. However, when casting from arrays or map containing\n`NULL`s, the produced `JSON` will have `null`s in it.",
                        "Cast from JSON": "Casting to `BOOLEAN`, `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INTEGER`,\n`BIGINT`, `REAL`, `DOUBLE` or `VARCHAR` is supported.\nCasting to `ARRAY` and `MAP` is supported when the element type of\nthe array is one of the supported types, or when the key type of the map\nis `VARCHAR` and value type of the map is one of the supported types.\nBehaviors of the casts are shown with the examples below:\n\n```\nSELECT CAST(JSON 'null' AS VARCHAR);\n-- NULL\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '1' AS INTEGER);\n-- 1\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '9223372036854775807' AS BIGINT);\n-- 9223372036854775807\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '\"abc\"' AS VARCHAR);\n-- abc\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON 'true' AS BOOLEAN);\n-- true\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '1.234' AS DOUBLE);\n-- 1.234\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '[1,23,456]' AS ARRAY(INTEGER));\n-- [1, 23, 456]\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '[1,null,456]' AS ARRAY(INTEGER));\n-- [1, NULL, 456]\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '[[1,23],[456]]' AS ARRAY(ARRAY(INTEGER)));\n-- [[1, 23], [456]]\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '{\"k1\":1,\"k2\":23,\"k3\":456}' AS MAP(VARCHAR, INTEGER));\n-- {k1=1, k2=23, k3=456}\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '{\"v1\":123,\"v2\":\"abc\",\"v3\":true}' AS\n            ROW(v1 BIGINT, v2 VARCHAR, v3 BOOLEAN));\n-- {v1=123, v2=abc, v3=true}\n\nSELECT CAST(JSON '[123,\"abc\",true]' AS\n            ROW(v1 BIGINT, v2 VARCHAR, v3 BOOLEAN));\n-- {v1=123, v2=abc, v3=true}\n```\n\nJSON arrays can have mixed element types and JSON maps can have mixed\nvalue types. This makes it impossible to cast them to SQL arrays and maps in\nsome cases.

Users may\nexperience latency or similar behavior if they issue a high volume of\nshort-running queries on a fault-tolerant cluster. As such, it is recommended to\nrun a dedicated fault-tolerant cluster for handling batch operations, separate\nfrom a cluster that is designated for a higher query volume.\n\nCatalogs using the following connectors support fault-tolerant execution of read\nand write operations:\n\n['{doc}`/connector/delta-lake`', '{doc}`/connector/hive`', '{doc}`/connector/iceberg`', '{doc}`/connector/mysql`', '{doc}`/connector/postgresql`', '{doc}`/connector/sqlserver`']\n\nCatalogs using other connectors only support fault-tolerant execution of read\noperations. When fault-tolerant execution is enabled on a cluster, write\noperations fail on any catalogs that do not support fault-tolerant\nexecution of those operations.\n\nThe exchange manager may send a large amount of data to the exchange storage,\nresulting in high I/O load on that storage. You can configure multiple storage\nlocations for use by the exchange manager to help balance the I/O load between\nthem.",

Query processing, detailed more in [](/overview/concepts) is\nbroken up into different stages, where tasks and splits are processed by\ndifferent nodes in the cluster. The lowest level splits retrieve data from the\ndata source with the help of the connector of the specific catalog. For\nfile system caching, these splits result in the retrieval of files from object\nstorage.\n\nDifferent nodes process splits with data from objects storage randomly over\ntime, but with preference for using a fixed set of nodes for a given file. If\nthe preferred nodes are too busy, the split, and hence the caching, takes place\non a non-preferred, less busy node. File system caching keeps copies of the\nretrieved files on a local cache storage, separate for each node. Over time the\nsame files from object storage are cached on any nodes that require the data\nfile for processing a specific task. Each cache on each node is managed\nseparately, following the TTL and size configuration, and cached files are\nevicted from the cache.\n\nYou can limit the number of hosts that are preferred to process these tasks with\n`fs.cache.preferred-hosts-count`. Query processing still uses all other nodes as\nrequired for the parallel processing of tasks, and therefore potentially caches\nfiles on more nodes than the preferred hosts only. A low setting, such as the\ndefault 2, can reduce the overall size of the cache because it can reduce how\noften the same file is cached on multiple nodes. A higher setting, up to the\nnumber of nodes in the cluster, distributes the workload across more workers by\ndefault, and leads to more resilience against node failures at the expense of\neffective cache size.\n\n(fs-cache-benefits)=",
                        "Benefits": "Enabling caching can result in the following significant benefits:\n\n**Reduced load on storage**\n\nEvery retrieved and cached file avoids repeated retrieval from the storage in\nsubsequent queries on the same worker. As a result the storage system does not\nhave to provide the file again and again.\n\nFor example, if your query accesses 100MB of files from the storage, the first\ntime the query runs 100MB are downloaded and cached. Any following query uses\nthese files. If your users run another 100 queries accessing the same files,\nyour storage system does not have to provide all data repeatedly. Without\ncaching it has to provide the same files again and again, resulting in up to\n10GB of total files to serve.\n\n**Increased query performance**\n\nCaching can provide significant performance benefits, by avoiding the repeated\nnetwork transfers and instead accessing copies of the files from a local\ncache. Performance gains are more significant if the performance of directly\naccessing the storage is low compared to accessing the local cache.\n\nFor example, if you access storage in a different network, different data\ncenter, or even different cloud-provider region query performance is slow. Adding\ncaching using fast, local storage has a significant impact and makes your\nqueries much faster.\n\nOn the other hand, if your storage is already running at very high performance\nfor I/O and network access, and your local cache storage is at similar speeds,\nor even slower, performance benefits can be minimal.\n\n**Reduced query costs**\n\nA result of the reduced load on the storage, mentioned earlier, is significantly\nreduced network traffic and access to storage. Network traffic and access, often\nin the form of API access, are often a considerable cost factor, specifically\nalso when hosted in public cloud provider systems.\n\n(fs-cache-configuration)=",

When processing a join statement, Trino loads\nthe right-most table of the join into memory as the build side, then streams the\nnext right-most table as the probe side to execute the join. If a query has\nmultiple joins, the result of this first join stays in memory as the build side,\nand the third right-most table is then used as the probe side, and so on for\nadditional joins. In the case where join order is made more complex, such as\nwhen using parentheses to specify specific parents for joins, Trino may execute\nmultiple lower-level joins at once, but each step of that process follows the\nsame logic, and the same applies when the results are ultimately joined\ntogether.\n\nBecause of this behavior, it is optimal to syntactically order joins in your SQL\nqueries from the largest tables to the smallest, as this minimizes memory usage.\n\nAs an example, if you have a small, medium, and large table and are using left\njoins:\n\n```\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  large_table l\n  LEFT JOIN medium_table m ON l.user_id = m.user_id\n  LEFT JOIN small_table s ON s.user_id = l.user_id\n```\n\n:::{warning}\nThis means of optimization is not a feature of Trino.

The explain plan does not\nshow a `Join` operator, if the join is pushed down to the data source by the\nconnector:\n\n```\nEXPLAIN SELECT c.custkey, o.orderkey\nFROM orders o JOIN customer c ON c.custkey = o.custkey;\n```\n\nThe following plan results from the PostgreSQL connector querying TPC-H\ndata in a PostgreSQL database.

In this release we have added a fast path for RCFile when using\nthe Binary SerDe (`LazyBinaryColumnarSerDe`).  In our\nmicro benchmarks, we see a gain between 2x and 4x in CPU efficiency compared\nto the generic (slow) path.  Since Hive data decoding accounts for a\nsignificant portion of the CPU time, this should\nresult in measurable gains for most queries over RC Binary encoded data.\nNote that this optimization may not result in a reduction in latency\nif your cluster is network or disk I/O bound.",

If the value is\nlarger than the number of machines available during query scheduling, Presto\nwill use all available machines.  The default value is `8`.\n\nThe maximum memory size of an aggregation is now\n`query.initial-hash-partitions` times `task.max-memory`.",

This can be a\nmajor performance gain for `JOIN` queries where one side of the join has\nonly a few partitions.  For example:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM data_1_year JOIN data_1_week USING (ds)\n```\n\nIf `data_1_year` and `data_1_week` are both partitioned on `ds`, the\nconnector will report back that one table has partitions for 365 days and the\nother table has partitions for only 7 days.  Then the optimizer will limit\nthe scan of the `data_1_year` table to only the 7 days that could possible\nmatch.  These constraints are combined with other predicates in the\nquery to further limit the data scanned.\n\n:::{note}\nThis is a backwards incompatible change with the previous connector SPI,\nso if you have written a connector, you will need to update your code\nbefore deploying this release.\n:::",

                        "Hive bucketed table fixes": "For queries over Hive bucketed tables, Presto will attempt to limit scans to\nthe buckets that could possible contain rows that match the WHERE clause.\nUnfortunately, the algorithm we were using to select the buckets was not\ncorrect, and sometimes we would either select the wrong files or fail to\nselect any files.  We have aligned\nthe algorithm with Hive and now the optimization works as expected.\n\nWe have also improved the algorithm for detecting tables that are not properly\nbucketed.  It is common for tables to declare bucketing in the Hive metadata, but\nnot actually be bucketed in HDFS.  When Presto detects this case, it fallback to a full scan of the\npartition.  Not only does this change make bucketing safer, but it makes it easier\nto migrate a table to use bucketing without rewriting all of the data."

                        "Type system": "In this release we have replaced the existing simple fixed type system\nwith a fully extensible type system and have added several new types.\nWe have also expanded the function system to support custom\narithmetic, comparison and cast operators. For example, the new date/time\ntypes include an operator for adding an `INTERVAL` to a `TIMESTAMP`.\n\nExisting functions have been updated to operate on and return the\nnewly added types.  For example, the ANSI color functions now operate\non a `COLOR` type, and the date/time functions operate on standard\nSQL date/time types (described below).\n\nFinally, plugins can now provide custom types and operators in addition\nto connectors and functions. This feature is highly experimental, so expect\nthe interfaces to change over the next few releases.  Also, since in SQL\nthere is only one namespace for types, you should be careful to make names\nfor custom types unique as we will add other common SQL types to Presto\nin the near future.",
                        "Date/time types": {
                          "Time zones": "This release has full support for time zone rules, which are needed to\nperform date/time calculations correctly. Typically, the session time\nzone is used for temporal calculations. This is the time zone of the\nclient computer that submits the query, if available. Otherwise, it is\nthe time zone of the server running the Presto coordinator.\n\nQueries that operate with time zones that follow daylight saving can\nproduce unexpected results. For example, if we run the following query\nto add 24 hours using in the `America/Los Angeles` time zone:\n\n```\nSELECT date_add('hour', 24, TIMESTAMP '2014-03-08 09:00:00');\n-- 2014-03-09 10:00:00.000\n```\n\nThe timestamp appears to only advance 23 hours. This is because on\nMarch 9th clocks in `America/Los Angeles` are turned forward 1 hour,\nso March 9th only has 23 hours. To advance the day part of the timestamp,\nuse the `day` unit instead:\n\n```\nSELECT date_add('day', 1, TIMESTAMP '2014-03-08 09:00:00');\n-- 2014-03-09 09:00:00.000\n```\n\nThis works because the {func}`date_add` function treats the timestamp as\nlist of fields, adds the value to the specified field and then rolls any\noverflow into the next higher field.\n\nTime zones are also necessary for parsing and printing timestamps.\nQueries that use this functionality can also produce unexpected results.\nFor example, on the same machine:\n\n```\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2014-03-09 02:30:00';\n```\n\nThe above query causes an error because there was no 2:30 AM on March 9th\nin `America/Los_Angeles` due to a daylight saving time transition.\n\nIn addition to normal `TIMESTAMP` values, Presto also supports the\n`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` type, where every value has an explicit time zone.\nFor example, the following query creates a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`:\n\n```\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2014-03-14 09:30:00 Europe/Berlin';\n-- 2014-03-14 09:30:00.000 Europe/Berlin\n```\n\nYou can also change the time zone of an existing timestamp using the\n`AT TIME ZONE` clause:\n\n```\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2014-03-14 09:30:00 Europe/Berlin'\n     AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles';\n-- 2014-03-14 01:30:00.000 America/Los_Angeles\n```\n\nBoth timestamps represent the same instant in time;\nthey differ only in the time zone used to print them.\n\nThe time zone of the session can be set on a per-query basis using the\n`X-Presto-Time-Zone` HTTP header, or via the\n`PrestoConnection.setTimeZoneId(String)` method in the JDBC driver.",
                          "Localization": "In addition to time zones, the language of the user is important when\nparsing and printing date/time types. This release adds localization\nsupport to the Presto engine and functions that require it:\n{func}`date_format` and {func}`date_parse`.\nFor example, if we set the language to Spanish:\n\n```\nSELECT date_format(TIMESTAMP '2001-01-09 09:04', '%M'); -- enero\n```\n\nIf we set the language to Japanese:\n\n```\nSELECT date_format(TIMESTAMP '2001-01-09 09:04', '%M'); -- 1月\n```\n\nThe language of the session can be set on a per-query basis using the\n`X-Presto-Language` HTTP header, or via the\n`PrestoConnection.setLocale(Locale)` method in the JDBC driver."

If one of your preferred\nselections is a non-FS cipher, you must also set the\n`http-server.https.excluded-cipher` property to an empty list to override the\ndefault exclusions.

Using a\ndifferent suite may require downloading and installing a different SunJCE\nimplementation package. Some locales may have export restrictions on cipher\nsuites. See the discussion in Java documentation that begins with [Customizing\nthe Encryption Algorithm Providers](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-316FB978-7588-442E-B829-B4973DB3B584).\n\n:::{note}\nIf you manage the coordinator's direct TLS implementation, monitor the CPU\nusage on the Trino coordinator after enabling HTTPS.

You need to run the {doc}`refresh-materialized-view`\nstatement after the creation to populate the materialized view with data. This\nmaterialized view is a physical manifestation of the query results at time of\nrefresh. The data is stored, and can be referenced by future queries.\n\nQueries accessing materialized views are typically faster than retrieving data\nfrom a view created with the same query. Any computation, aggregation, and other\noperation to create the data is performed once during refresh of the\nmaterialized views, as compared to each time of accessing the view. Multiple\nreads of view data over time, or by multiple users, all trigger repeated\nprocessing. This is avoided for materialized views.\n\nThe optional `OR REPLACE` clause causes the materialized view to be replaced\nif it already exists rather than raising an error.\n\nThe optional `IF NOT EXISTS` clause causes the materialized view only to be\ncreated if it does not exist yet.\n\nNote that `OR REPLACE` and `IF NOT EXISTS` are mutually exclusive clauses.\n\n(mv-grace-period)=\nThe optional `GRACE PERIOD` clause specifies how long the query materialization\nis used for querying:\n\n['Within the grace period since last refresh, data retrieval is highly\\nperformant because the query materialization is used. However, the data may\\nnot be up to date with the base tables.', 'After the grace period has elapsed, the data of the materialized view is\\ncomputed on-the-fly using the `query`. Retrieval is therefore slower, but the\\ndata is up to date with the base tables.', 'If not specified, the grace period defaults to infinity, and therefore all\\nqueries are within the grace period.', 'Every [](refresh-materialized-view) operation resets the start time for the\\ngrace period.']\n\nThe optional `COMMENT` clause causes a `string` comment to be stored with\nthe metadata about the materialized view. The comment is displayed with the\n{doc}`show-create-materialized-view` statement and is available in the table\n`system.metadata.materialized_view_properties`.\n\nThe optional `WITH` clause is used to define properties for the materialized\nview creation. Separate multiple property/value pairs by commas. The connector\nuses the properties as input parameters for the materialized view refresh\noperation. The supported properties are different for each connector and\ndetailed in the SQL support section of the specific connector's documentation.\n\nAfter successful creation, all metadata about the materialized view is available\nin a {ref}`system table <system-metadata-materialized-views>`.",

Patterns of interest are\nspecified using row pattern syntax based on regular expressions. The input to\npattern matching is a table, a view or a subquery. For each detected match, one\nor more rows are returned. They contain requested information about the match.\n\nRow pattern matching is a powerful tool when analyzing complex sequences of\nevents. The following examples show some of the typical use cases:\n\n['in trade applications, tracking trends or identifying customers with specific\\nbehavioral patterns', 'in shipping applications, tracking packages through all possible valid paths,', 'in financial applications, detecting unusual incidents, which might signal\\nfraud']",

This behavior\nis analogous to the semantics of `PARTITION BY` clause in {ref}`window\nspecification<window-clause>`. In the example, the `orders` table is\npartitioned by the `custkey` value, so that pattern matching is performed for\nall orders of a specific customer independently from orders of other\ncustomers.\n\n```\nORDER BY orderdate\n```\n\nThe optional `ORDER BY` clause is generally useful to allow matching on an\nordered data set. For example, sorting the input by `orderdate` allows for\nmatching on a trend of changes over time.\n\n(row-pattern-measures)=",

                      "content": {
                        "Window with row pattern recognition": "**Window specification:**\n\n```\n(\n[ existing_window_name ]\n[ PARTITION BY column [, ...] ]\n[ ORDER BY column [, ...] ]\n[ window_frame ]\n)\n```\n\n**Window frame:**\n\n```\n[ MEASURES measure_definition [, ...] ]\nframe_extent\n[ AFTER MATCH skip_to ]\n[ INITIAL | SEEK ]\n[ PATTERN ( row_pattern ) ]\n[ SUBSET subset_definition [, ...] ]\n[ DEFINE variable_definition [, ...] ]\n```\n\nGenerally, a window frame specifies the `frame_extent`, which defines the\n\"sliding window\" of rows to be processed by a window function. It can be\ndefined in terms of `ROWS`, `RANGE` or `GROUPS`.\n\nA window frame with row pattern recognition involves many other syntactical\ncomponents, mandatory or optional, and enforces certain limitations on the\n`frame_extent`.\n\n**Window frame with row pattern recognition:**\n\n```\n[ MEASURES measure_definition [, ...] ]\nROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND frame_end\n[ AFTER MATCH skip_to ]\n[ INITIAL | SEEK ]\nPATTERN ( row_pattern )\n[ SUBSET subset_definition [, ...] ]\nDEFINE variable_definition [, ...]\n```",
                        "Description of the pattern recognition clauses": "The `frame_extent` with row pattern recognition must be defined in terms of\n`ROWS`. The frame start must be at the `CURRENT ROW`, which limits the\nallowed frame extent values to the following:\n\n```\nROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND CURRENT ROW\n\nROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND <expression> FOLLOWING\n\nROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING\n```\n\nFor every input row processed by the window, the portion of rows enclosed by\nthe `frame_extent` limits the search area for row pattern recognition. Unlike\nin `MATCH_RECOGNIZE`, where the pattern search can explore all rows until the\npartition end, and all rows of the partition are available for computations, in\nwindow structures the pattern matching can neither match rows nor retrieve\ninput values outside the frame.\n\nBesides the `frame_extent`, pattern matching requires the `PATTERN` and\n`DEFINE` clauses.\n\nThe `PATTERN` clause specifies a row pattern, which is a form of a regular\nexpression with some syntactical extensions. The row pattern syntax is similar\nto the {ref}`row pattern syntax in MATCH_RECOGNIZE<row-pattern-syntax>`.\nHowever, the anchor patterns `^` and `$` are not allowed in a window\nspecification.\n\nThe `DEFINE` clause defines the row pattern primary variables in terms of\nboolean conditions that must be satisfied. It is similar to the\n{ref}`DEFINE clause of MATCH_RECOGNIZE<row-pattern-variable-definitions>`.\nThe only difference is that the window syntax does not support the\n`MATCH_NUMBER` function.\n\nThe `MEASURES` clause is syntactically similar to the\n{ref}`MEASURES clause of MATCH_RECOGNIZE<row-pattern-measures>`. The only\nlimitation is that the `MATCH_NUMBER` function is not allowed. However, the\nsemantics of this clause differs between `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` and window.\nWhile in `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` every measure produces an output column, the\nmeasures in window should be considered as **definitions** associated with the\nwindow structure. They can be called over the window, in the same manner as\nregular window functions:\n\n```\nSELECT cust_key, value OVER w, label OVER w\n    FROM orders\n    WINDOW w AS (\n                 PARTITION BY cust_key\n                 ORDER BY order_date\n                 MEASURES\n                        RUNNING LAST(total_price) AS value,\n                        CLASSIFIER() AS label\n                 ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING\n                 PATTERN (A B+ C+)\n                 DEFINE\n                        B AS B.value < PREV (B.value),\n                        C AS C.value > PREV (C.value)\n                )\n```\n\nMeasures defined in a window can be referenced in the `SELECT` clause and in\nthe `ORDER BY` clause of the enclosing query.\n\nThe `RUNNING` and `FINAL` keywords are allowed in the `MEASURES` clause.\nThey can precede a logical navigation function `FIRST` or `LAST`, or an\naggregate function. However, they have no effect. Every computation is\nperformed from the position of the final row of the match, so the semantics is\neffectively `FINAL`.\n\nThe `AFTER MATCH SKIP` clause has the same syntax as the\n{ref}`AFTER MATCH SKIP clause of MATCH_RECOGNIZE<after-match-skip>`.\n\nThe `INITIAL` or `SEEK` modifier is specific to row pattern recognition in\nwindow. With `INITIAL`, which is the default, the pattern match for an input\nrow can only be found starting from that row. With `SEEK`, if there is no\nmatch starting from the current row, the engine tries to find a match starting\nfrom subsequent rows within the frame. As a result, it is possible to associate\nan input row with a match which is detached from that row.\n\nThe `SUBSET` clause is used to define {ref}`union variables\n<row-pattern-union-variables>` as sets of primary pattern variables. You can\nuse union variables to refer to a set of rows matched to any primary pattern\nvariable from the subset:\n\n```\nSUBSET U = (A, B)\n```\n\nThe following expression returns the `total_price` value from the last row\nmatched to either `A` or `B`:\n\n```\nLAST(U.total_price)\n```\n\nIf you want to refer to all rows of the match, there is no need to define a\n`SUBSET` containing all pattern variables. There is an implicit *universal\npattern variable* applied to any non prefixed column name and any\n`CLASSIFIER` call without an argument. The following expression returns the\n`total_price` value from the last matched row:\n\n```\nLAST(total_price)\n```\n\nThe following call returns the primary pattern variable of the first matched\nrow:\n\n```\nFIRST(CLASSIFIER())\n```\n\nIn window, unlike in `MATCH_RECOGNIZE`, you cannot specify `ONE ROW PER\nMATCH` or `ALL ROWS PER MATCH`. This is because all calls over window,\nwhether they are regular window functions or measures, must comply with the\nwindow semantics. A call over window is supposed to produce exactly one output\nrow for every input row. And so, the output mode of pattern recognition in\nwindow is a combination of `ONE ROW PER MATCH` and `WITH UNMATCHED ROWS`.",
                        "Processing input with row pattern recognition": "Pattern recognition in window processes input rows in two different cases:\n\n['upon a row pattern measure call over the window:', '```\\nsome_measure OVER w\\n```', 'upon a window function call over the window:', '```\\nsum(total_price) OVER w\\n```']\n\nThe output row produced for each input row, consists of:\n\n['all values from the input row', 'the value of the called measure or window function, computed with respect to\\nthe pattern match associated with the row']\n\nProcessing the input can be described as the following sequence of steps:\n\n['Partition the input data accordingly to `PARTITION BY`', 'Order each partition by the `ORDER BY` expressions', \"For every row of the ordered partition:\\n: If the row is 'skipped' by a match of some previous row:\\n: - For a measure, produce a one-row output as for an unmatched row\\n- For a window function, evaluate the function over an empty frame\\nand produce a one-row output\", 'Otherwise:\\n: - Determine the frame extent\\n- Try match the row pattern starting from the current row within\\nthe frame extent\\n- If no match is found, and `SEEK` is specified, try to find a match\\nstarting from subsequent rows within the frame extent', \"If no match is found:\\n: - For a measure, produce a one-row output for an unmatched row\\n  - For a window function, evaluate the function over an empty\\n    frame and produce a one-row output\\n\\nOtherwise:\\n: - For a measure, produce a one-row output for the match\\n  - For a window function, evaluate the function over a frame\\n    limited to the matched rows sequence and produce a one-row\\n    output\\n  - Evaluate the `AFTER MATCH SKIP` clause, and mark the 'skipped'\\n    rows\\n\"]",
                        "Empty matches and unmatched rows": "If no match can be associated with a particular input row, the row is\n*unmatched*. This happens when no match can be found for the row. This also\nhappens when no match is attempted for the row, because it is skipped by the\n`AFTER MATCH SKIP` clause of some preceding row. For an unmatched row,\nevery row pattern measure is `null`. Every window function is evaluated over\nan empty frame.\n\nAn *empty match* is a successful match which does not involve any pattern\nvariables. In other words, an empty match does not contain any rows. If an\nempty match is associated with an input row, every row pattern measure for that\nrow is evaluated over an empty sequence of rows. All navigation operations and\nthe `CLASSIFIER` function return `null`. Every window function is evaluated\nover an empty frame.\n\nIn most cases, the results for empty matches and unmatched rows are the same.\nA constant measure can be helpful to distinguish between them:\n\nThe following call returns `'matched'` for every matched row, including empty\nmatches, and `null` for every unmatched row:\n\n```\nmatched OVER (\n              ...\n              MEASURES 'matched' AS matched\n              ...\n             )\n```"

It defines\na list of queries to process, including recursive processing of suitable\nqueries.\n\n:::{warning}\nThis feature is experimental only. Proceed to use it only if you understand\npotential query failures and the impact of the recursion processing on your\nworkload.\n:::\n\nA recursive `WITH`-query must be shaped as a `UNION` of two relations. The\nfirst relation is called the *recursion base*, and the second relation is called\nthe *recursion step*. Trino supports recursive `WITH`-queries with a single\nrecursive reference to a `WITH`-query from within the query. The name `T` of\nthe query `T` can be mentioned once in the `FROM` clause of the recursion\nstep relation.\n\nThe following listing shows a simple example, that displays a commonly used\nform of a single query in the list:\n\n```\nWITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (\n    VALUES (1)\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT n + 1 FROM t WHERE n < 4\n)\nSELECT sum(n) FROM t;\n```\n\nIn the preceding query the simple assignment `VALUES (1)` defines the\nrecursion base relation. `SELECT n + 1 FROM t WHERE n < 4` defines the\nrecursion step relation. The recursion processing performs these steps:\n\n['recursive base yields `1`', 'first recursion yields `1 + 1 = 2`', 'second recursion uses the result from the first and adds one: `2 + 1 = 3`', 'third recursion uses the result from the second and adds one again:\\n`3 + 1 = 4`', 'fourth recursion aborts since `n = 4`', 'this results in `t` having values `1`, `2`, `3` and `4`', 'the final statement performs the sum operation of these elements with the\\nfinal result value `10`']\n\nThe types of the returned columns are those of the base relation. Therefore it\nis required that types in the step relation can be coerced to base relation\ntypes.\n\nThe `RECURSIVE` clause applies to all queries in the `WITH` list, but not\nall of them must be recursive. If a `WITH`-query is not shaped according to\nthe rules mentioned above or it does not contain a recursive reference, it is\nprocessed like a regular `WITH`-query. Column aliases are mandatory for all\nthe queries in the recursive `WITH` list.\n\nThe following limitations apply as a result of following the SQL standard and\ndue to implementation choices, in addition to `WITH` clause limitations:\n\n['only single-element recursive cycles are supported. Like in regular\\n`WITH`-queries, references to previous queries in the `WITH` list are\\nallowed. References to following queries are forbidden.', 'usage of outer joins, set operations, limit clause, and others is not always\\nallowed in the step relation', \"recursion depth is fixed, defaults to `10`, and doesn't depend on the actual\\nquery results\"]\n\nYou can adjust the recursion depth with the {doc}`session property\n</sql/set-session>` `max_recursion_depth`.

An empty list, specified as\n`()` is also valid.\n\nThe `type` value after the `RETURNS` keyword identifies the [data\ntype](/language/types) of the UDF output.\n\nThe optional `LANGUAGE` characteristic identifies the language used for the UDF\ndefinition with `language`. The `SQL` and `PYTHON` languages are supported by\ndefault. Additional languages may be supported via a language engine plugin.\nIf not specified, the default language is `SQL`.\n\nThe optional `DETERMINISTIC` or `NOT DETERMINISTIC` characteristic declares that\nthe UDF is deterministic. This means that repeated UDF calls with identical\ninput parameters yield the same result. A UDF is non-deterministic if it calls\nany non-deterministic UDFs and [functions](/functions). By default, UDFs are\nassumed to have a deterministic behavior.\n\nThe optional `RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT` characteristic declares that the UDF\nreturns a `NULL` value when any of the input parameters are `NULL`. The UDF is\nnot invoked with a `NULL` input value.\n\nThe `CALLED ON NULL INPUT` characteristic declares that the UDF is invoked with\n`NULL` input parameter values.\n\nThe `RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT` and `CALLED ON NULL INPUT` characteristics are\nmutually exclusive, with `CALLED ON NULL INPUT` as the default.\n\nThe security declaration of `SECURITY INVOKER` or `SECURITY DEFINER` is only\nvalid for catalog UDFs. It sets the mode for processing the UDF with the\npermissions of the user who calls the UDF (`INVOKER`) or the user who created\nthe UDF (`DEFINER`).\n\nThe `COMMENT` characteristic can be used to provide information about the\nfunction to other users as `description`. The information is accessible with\n[](/sql/show-functions).\n\nThe optional `WITH` clause can be used to specify properties for the function.\nThe available properties vary based on the function language. For\n[](/udf/python), the `handler` property specifies the name of the Python\nfunction to invoke.\n\nFor SQL UDFs the body of the UDF can either be a simple single `RETURN`\nstatement with an expression, or compound list of `statements` in a `BEGIN`\nblock. UDF must contain a `RETURN` statement at the end of the top-level block,\neven if it's unreachable.\n\nFor UDFs in other languages, the `definition` is enclosed in a `$$`-quoted\nstring.",

The same pattern applies to all other\nfollowing sections.\n\nA very simple SQL UDF that returns a static value without requiring any input:\n\n```\nFUNCTION answer()\nRETURNS BIGINT\nRETURN 42\n```\n\nA full example of this UDF as inline UDF and usage in a string concatenation\nwith a cast:\n\n```\nWITH\n  FUNCTION answer()\n  RETURNS BIGINT\n  RETURN 42\nSELECT 'The answer is ' || CAST(answer() as varchar);\n-- The answer is 42\n```\n\nProvided the catalog `example` supports UDF storage in the `default` schema, you\ncan use the following:\n\n```\nCREATE FUNCTION example.default.answer()\n  RETURNS BIGINT\n  RETURN 42;\n```\n\nWith the UDF stored in the catalog, you can run the UDF multiple times without\nrepeated definition:\n\n```\nSELECT example.default.answer() + 1; -- 43\nSELECT 'The answer is ' || CAST(example.default.answer() as varchar); -- The answer is 42\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the SQL PATH in the [](config-properties) to a\ncatalog and schema that support UDF storage:\n\n```\nsql.default-function-catalog=example\nsql.default-function-schema=default\nsql.path=example.default\n```\n\nNow you can manage UDFs without the full path:\n\n```\nCREATE FUNCTION answer()\n  RETURNS BIGINT\n  RETURN 42;\n```\n\nUDF invocation works without the full path:\n\n```\nSELECT answer() + 5; -- 47\n```",
                            "Declaration examples": "The result of calling the UDF `answer()` is always identical, so you can\ndeclare it as deterministic, and add some other information:\n\n```\nFUNCTION answer()\nLANGUAGE SQL\nDETERMINISTIC\nRETURNS BIGINT\nCOMMENT 'Provide the answer to the question about life, the universe, and everything.'\nRETURN 42\n```\n\nThe comment and other information about the UDF is visible in the output of\n[](/sql/show-functions).\n\nA simple UDF that returns a greeting back to the input string `fullname`\nconcatenating two strings and the input value:\n\n```\nFUNCTION hello(fullname VARCHAR)\nRETURNS VARCHAR\nRETURN 'Hello, ' || fullname || '!'\n```\n\nFollowing is an example invocation:\n\n```\nSELECT hello('Jane Doe'); -- Hello, Jane Doe!\n```\n\nA first example UDF, that uses multiple statements in a `BEGIN` block. It\ncalculates the result of a multiplication of the input integer with `99`. The\n`bigint` data type is used for all variables and values. The value of integer\n`99` is cast to `bigint` in the default value assignment for the variable `x`:\n\n```\nFUNCTION times_ninety_nine(a bigint)\nRETURNS bigint\nBEGIN\n  DECLARE x bigint DEFAULT CAST(99 AS bigint);\n  RETURN x * a;\nEND\n```\n\nFollowing is an example invocation:\n\n```\nSELECT times_ninety_nine(CAST(2 as bigint)); -- 198\n```",

                            "Fibonacci example": "This SQL UDF calculates the `n`-th value in the Fibonacci series, in which each\nnumber is the sum of the two preceding ones. The two initial values are set to\n`1` as the defaults for `a` and `b`. The UDF uses an `IF` statement condition to\nreturn `1` for all input values of `2` or less. The `WHILE` block then starts to\ncalculate each number in the series, starting with `a=1` and `b=1` and iterates\nuntil it reaches the `n`-th position. In each iteration it sets `a` and `b` for\nthe preceding to values, so it can calculate the sum, and finally return it.\nNote that processing the UDF takes longer and longer with higher `n` values, and\nthe result is deterministic:\n\n```\nFUNCTION fib(n bigint)\nRETURNS bigint\nBEGIN\n  DECLARE a, b bigint DEFAULT 1;\n  DECLARE c bigint;\n  IF n <= 2 THEN\n    RETURN 1;\n  END IF;\n  WHILE n > 2 DO\n    SET n = n - 1;\n    SET c = a + b;\n    SET a = b;\n    SET b = c;\n  END WHILE;\n  RETURN c;\nEND\n```\n\nFollowing are a couple of example invocations with result and explanation:\n\n```\nSELECT fib(-1); -- 1\nSELECT fib(0); -- 1\nSELECT fib(1); -- 1\nSELECT fib(2); -- 1\nSELECT fib(3); -- 2\nSELECT fib(4); -- 3\nSELECT fib(5); -- 5\nSELECT fib(6); -- 8\nSELECT fib(7); -- 13\nSELECT fib(8); -- 21\n```",
                            "Labels and loops": "This SQL UDF uses the `top` label to name the `WHILE` block, and then controls\nthe flow with conditional statements, `ITERATE`, and `LEAVE`. For the values of\n`a=1` and `a=2` in the first two iterations of the loop the `ITERATE` call moves\nthe flow up to `top` before `b` is ever increased. Then `b` is increased for the\nvalues `a=3`, `a=4`, `a=5`, `a=6`, and `a=7`, resulting in `b=5`. The `LEAVE`\ncall then causes the exit of the block before a is increased further to `10` and\ntherefore the result of the UDF is `5`:\n\n```\nFUNCTION labels()\nRETURNS bigint\nBEGIN\n  DECLARE a, b int DEFAULT 0;\n  top: WHILE a < 10 DO\n    SET a = a + 1;\n    IF a < 3 THEN\n      ITERATE top;\n    END IF;\n    SET b = b + 1;\n    IF a > 6 THEN\n      LEAVE top;\n    END IF;\n  END WHILE;\n  RETURN b;\nEND\n```\n\nThis SQL UDF implements calculating the `n` to the power of `p` by repeated\nmultiplication and keeping track of the number of multiplications performed.\nNote that this SQL UDF does not return the correct `0` for `p=0` since the `top`\nblock is merely escaped and the value of `n` is returned. The same incorrect\nbehavior happens for negative values of `p`:\n\n```\nFUNCTION power(n int, p int)\nRETURNS int\n  BEGIN\n    DECLARE r int DEFAULT n;\n    top: LOOP\n      IF p <= 1 THEN\n        LEAVE top;\n      END IF;\n      SET r = r * n;\n      SET p = p - 1;\n    END LOOP;\n    RETURN r;\n  END\n```\n\nFollowing are a couple of example invocations with result and explanation:\n\n```\nSELECT power(2, 2); -- 4\nSELECT power(2, 8); -- 256\nSELECT power(3, 3); -- 256\nSELECT power(3, 0); -- 3, which is wrong\nSELECT power(3, -2); -- 3, which is wrong\n```\n\nThis SQL UDF returns `7` as a result of the increase of `b` in the loop from\n`a=3` to `a=10`:\n\n```\nFUNCTION test_repeat_continue()\nRETURNS bigint\nBEGIN\n  DECLARE a int DEFAULT 0;\n  DECLARE b int DEFAULT 0;\n  top: REPEAT\n    SET a = a + 1;\n    IF a <= 3 THEN\n      ITERATE top;\n    END IF;\n    SET b = b + 1;\n  UNTIL a >= 10\n  END REPEAT;\n  RETURN b;\nEND\n```\n\nThis SQL UDF returns `2` and shows that labels can be repeated and label usage\nwithin a block refers to the label of that block:\n\n```\nFUNCTION test()\nRETURNS int\nBEGIN\n  DECLARE r int DEFAULT 0;\n  abc: LOOP\n    SET r = r + 1;\n    LEAVE abc;\n  END LOOP;\n  abc: LOOP\n    SET r = r + 1;\n    LEAVE abc;\n  END LOOP;\n  RETURN r;\nEND\n```",
                            "SQL UDFs and built-in functions": "This SQL UDF shows that multiple data types and built-in functions like\n`length()` and `cardinality()` can be used in a UDF. The two nested `BEGIN`\nblocks also show how variable names are local within these blocks `x`, but the\nglobal `r` from the top-level block can be accessed in the nested blocks:\n\n```\nFUNCTION test()\nRETURNS bigint\nBEGIN\n  DECLARE r bigint DEFAULT 0;\n  BEGIN\n    DECLARE x varchar DEFAULT 'hello';\n    SET r = r + length(x);\n  END;\n  BEGIN\n    DECLARE x array(int) DEFAULT array[1, 2, 3];\n    SET r = r + cardinality(x);\n  END;\n  RETURN r;\nEND\n```",
                            "Optional parameter example": "UDFs can invoke other UDFs and other functions. The full signature of a UDF is\ncomposed of the UDF name and parameters, and determines the exact UDF to use.\nYou can declare multiple UDFs with the same name, but with a different number of\narguments or different argument types. One example use case is to implement an\noptional parameter.\n\nThe following SQL UDF truncates a string to the specified length including three\ndots at the end of the output:\n\n```\nFUNCTION dots(input varchar, length integer)\nRETURNS varchar\nBEGIN\n  IF length(input) > length THEN\n    RETURN substring(input, 1, length-3) || '...';\n  END IF;\n  RETURN input;\nEND;\n```\n\nFollowing are example invocations and output:\n\n```\nSELECT dots('A long string that will be shortened',15);\n-- A long strin...\nSELECT  dots('A short string',15);\n-- A short string\n```\n\nIf you want to provide a UDF with the same name, but without the parameter\nfor length, you can create another UDF that invokes the preceding UDF:\n\n```\nFUNCTION dots(input varchar)\nRETURNS varchar\nRETURN dots(input, 15);\n```\n\nYou can now use both UDFs. When the length parameter is omitted, the default\nvalue from the second declaration is used.\n\n```\nSELECT dots('A long string that will be shortened',15);\n-- A long strin...\nSELECT dots('A long string that will be shortened');\n-- A long strin...\nSELECT dots('A long string that will be shortened',20);\n-- A long string tha...\n```",
                            "Date string parsing example": "This example SQL UDF parses a date string of type `VARCHAR` into `TIMESTAMP WITH\nTIME ZONE`. Date strings are commonly represented by ISO 8601 standard, such as\n`2023-12-01`, `2023-12-01T23`. Date strings are also often represented in the\n`YYYYmmdd` and `YYYYmmddHH` format, such as `20230101` and `2023010123`. Hive\ntables can use this format to represent day and hourly partitions, for example\n`/day=20230101`, `/hour=2023010123`.\n\nThis UDF parses date strings in a best-effort fashion and can be used as a\nreplacement for date string manipulation functions such as `date`, `date_parse`,\n`from_iso8601_date`,  and `from_iso8601_timestamp`.\n\nNote that the UDF defaults the time value to `00:00:00.000` and the time\nzone to the session time zone:\n\n```\nFUNCTION from_date_string(date_string VARCHAR)\nRETURNS TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE\nBEGIN\n  IF date_string like '%-%' THEN -- ISO 8601\n    RETURN from_iso8601_timestamp(date_string);\n  ELSEIF length(date_string) = 8 THEN -- YYYYmmdd\n      RETURN date_parse(date_string, '%Y%m%d');\n  ELSEIF length(date_string) = 10 THEN -- YYYYmmddHH\n      RETURN date_parse(date_string, '%Y%m%d%H');\n  END IF;\n  RETURN NULL;\nEND\n```\n\nFollowing are a couple of example invocations with result and explanation:\n\n```\nSELECT from_date_string('2023-01-01'); -- 2023-01-01 00:00:00.000 UTC (using the ISO 8601 format)\nSELECT from_date_string('2023-01-01T23'); -- 2023-01-01 23:00:00.000 UTC (using the ISO 8601 format)\nSELECT from_date_string('2023-01-01T23:23:23'); -- 2023-01-01 23:23:23.000 UTC (using the ISO 8601 format)\nSELECT from_date_string('20230101'); -- 2023-01-01 00:00:00.000 UTC (using the YYYYmmdd format)\nSELECT from_date_string('2023010123'); -- 2023-01-01 23:00:00.000 UTC (using the YYYYmmddHH format)\nSELECT from_date_string(NULL); -- NULL (handles NULL string)\nSELECT from_date_string('abc'); -- NULL (not matched to any format)\n```",

It can therefore define the complete logic in the `RETURN` clause.\n\nThe following statement shows the same capability within the SQL UDF itself.\nNote the duplicate `RETURN` inside and outside the `CASE` statement and the\nrequired `END CASE;`. The second `RETURN` statement is required, because a SQL\nUDF must end with a `RETURN` statement.
