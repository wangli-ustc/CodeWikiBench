It uses JSDOM to create a DOM, and adds objects `window` and `document` to `global` to mock the browser environment.\n\n['\\\\[!NOTE]\\nThe layout cannot work in `jsdomIt` tests because JSDOM has no rendering engine, hence the pseudo-browser environment.']\n\nExample :\n\n```\nimport { ensureNodeFromSelector, jsdomIt } from './tests/util.js';\n\njsdomIt('should add element \"thing\" in the SVG', ({ svg }) => {\n  // Code in this block runs in a pseudo-browser environment\n  addThing(svg); // The svg item is the D3 selection of the SVG node\n  const svgNode = ensureNodeFromSelector('svg'); // Retrieve the DOM node using the DOM API\n  expect(svgNode.querySelector('thing')).not.toBeNull(); // Test the structure of the SVG\n});\n```\n\nThey can be used to test any method that interacts with the DOM, including for testing renderers.

It will be replaced automatically with the current version number when the release happens.\n\neg: `# Feature Name (v<MERMAID_RELEASE_VERSION>+)`\n\nWe know it can sometimes be hard to code _and_ write user documentation.\n\nCreate another issue specifically for the documentation.\nYou will need to help with the PR, but definitely ask for help if you feel stuck.\nWhen it feels hard to write stuff out, explaining it to someone and having that person ask you clarifying questions can often be 80% of the work!\n\nWhen in doubt, write up and submit what you can.

So, directives are applied on top of the default configuration. The beauty of directives is that you can use them to alter configuration settings for a specific diagram, i.e. at an individual level.\n\nWhile directives allow you to change most of the default configuration settings, there are some that are not available, for security reasons. Also, you have the _option to define the set of configurations_ that you wish to allow diagram authors to override with directives.",
            "Types of Directives options": "Mermaid basically supports two types of configuration options to be overridden by directives.\n\n['_General/Top Level configurations_ : These are the configurations that are available and applied to all the diagram. **Some of the most important top-level** configurations are:', ['theme', 'fontFamily', 'logLevel', 'securityLevel', 'startOnLoad', 'secure'], '_Diagram-specific configurations_ : These are the configurations that are available and applied to a specific diagram. For each diagram there are specific configuration that will alter how that particular diagram looks and behaves.\\nFor example, `mirrorActors` is a configuration that is specific to the `SequenceDiagram` and alters whether the actors are mirrored or not. So this config is available only for the `SequenceDiagram` type.']\n\n**NOTE:** Not all configuration options are listed here. To get hold of all the configuration options, please refer to the [defaultConfig.ts](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/blob/develop/packages/mermaid/src/defaultConfig.ts) in the source code.\n\n['**Note**\\nWe plan to publish a complete list of top-level configurations & diagram-specific configurations with their possible values in the docs soon.']",
            "Declaring directives": "Now that we have defined the types of configurations that are available, we can learn how to declare directives.\nA directive always starts and ends with `%%` signs with directive text in between, like `%% {directive_text} %%`.\n\nHere the structure of a directive text is like a nested key-value pair map or a JSON object with root being _init_. Where all the general configurations are defined in the top level, and all the diagram specific configurations are defined one level deeper with diagram type as key/root for that section.\n\nThe following code snippet shows the structure of a directive:\n\n```\n%%{\n  init: {\n    \"theme\": \"dark\",\n    \"fontFamily\": \"monospace\",\n    \"logLevel\": \"info\",\n    \"flowchart\": {\n      \"htmlLabels\": true,\n      \"curve\": \"linear\"\n    },\n    \"sequence\": {\n      \"mirrorActors\": true\n    }\n  }\n}%%\n```\n\nYou can also define the directives in a single line, like this:\n\n```\n%%{init: { **insert configuration options here** } }%%\n```\n\nFor example, the following code snippet:\n\n```\n%%{init: { \"sequence\": { \"mirrorActors\":false }}}%%\n```\n\n**Notes:**\nThe JSON object that is passed as {**argument**} must be valid key value pairs and encased in quotation marks or it will be ignored.\nValid Key Value pairs can be found in config.\n\nExample with a simple graph:\n\n```\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'dark' } }%%\ngraph LR\nA-->B\n```\n\n```\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'dark' } }%%\ngraph LR\nA-->B\n```\n\nHere the directive declaration will set the `logLevel` to `debug` and the `theme` to `dark` for a rendered mermaid diagram, changing the appearance of the diagram itself.\n\nNote: You can use 'init' or 'initialize' as both are acceptable as init directives. Also note that `%%init%%` and `%%initialize%%` directives will be grouped together after they are parsed.\n\n```\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'forest' } }%%\n%%{initialize: { 'logLevel': 'fatal', \"theme\":'dark', 'startOnLoad': true } }%%\n...\n```\n\n```\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'forest' } }%%\n%%{initialize: { 'logLevel': 'fatal', \"theme\":'dark', 'startOnLoad': true } }%%\n...\n```\n\nFor example, parsing the above generates a single `%%init%%` JSON object below, combining the two directives and carrying over the last value given for `loglevel`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"logLevel\": \"fatal\",\n  \"theme\": \"dark\",\n  \"startOnLoad\": true\n}\n```\n\nThis will then be sent to `mermaid.initialize(...)` for rendering.",

Otherwise, it throws an error.\n\nThe parseError function will be called when the parse function throws an error. It will not be called if `parseOptions.suppressErrors` is set to `true`.\n\nIt is possible to override this function in order to handle the error in an application-specific way.\n\nThe code-example below in meta code illustrates how this could work:\n\n```\nmermaid.parseError = function (err, hash) {\n  displayErrorInGui(err);\n};\n\nconst textFieldUpdated = async function () {\n  const textStr = getTextFromFormField('code');\n\n  if (await mermaid.parse(textStr)) {\n    reRender(textStr);\n  }\n};\n\nbindEventHandler('change', 'code', textFieldUpdated);\n```"

The reason is that the user content can contain embedded malicious scripts that will run when the data is presented. For Mermaid this is a risk, specially as mermaid diagrams contain many characters that are used in html which makes the standard sanitation unusable as it also breaks the diagrams. We still make an effort to sanitize the incoming code and keep refining the process but it is hard to guarantee that there are no loop holes.\n\nAs an extra level of security for sites with external users we are happy to introduce a new security level in which the diagram is rendered in a sandboxed iframe preventing JavaScript in the code from being executed. This is a great step forward for better security.\n\n_Unfortunately you cannot have a cake and eat it at the same time which in this case means that some of the interactive functionality gets blocked along with the possible malicious code._",

          "content": {
            "Introduction to Block Diagrams": {
              "Definition and Purpose": "Block diagrams are an intuitive and efficient way to represent complex systems, processes, or architectures visually. They are composed of blocks and connectors, where blocks represent the fundamental components or functions, and connectors show the relationship or flow between these components. This method of diagramming is essential in various fields such as engineering, software development, and process management.\n\nThe primary purpose of block diagrams is to provide a high-level view of a system, allowing for easy understanding and analysis without delving into the intricate details of each component. This makes them particularly useful for simplifying complex systems and for explaining the overall structure and interaction of components within a system.\n\nMany people use mermaid flowcharts for this purpose. A side-effect of this is that the automatic layout sometimes move shapes to positions that the diagram maker does not want. Block diagrams use a different approach. In this diagram we give the author full control over where the shapes are positioned.",
              "General Use Cases": "Block diagrams have a wide range of applications across various industries and disciplines. Some of the key use cases include:\n\n['**Software Architecture**: In software development, block diagrams can be used to illustrate the architecture of a software application. This includes showing how different modules or services interact, data flow, and high-level component interaction.', '**Network Diagrams**: Block diagrams are ideal for representing network architectures in IT and telecommunications. They can depict how different network devices and services are interconnected, including routers, switches, firewalls, and the flow of data across the network.', '**Process Flowcharts**: In business and manufacturing, block diagrams can be employed to create process flowcharts. These flowcharts represent various stages of a business or manufacturing process, helping to visualize the sequence of steps, decision points, and the flow of control.', '**Electrical Systems**: Engineers use block diagrams to represent electrical systems and circuitry. They can illustrate the high-level structure of an electrical system, the interaction between different electrical components, and the flow of electrical currents.', '**Educational Purposes**: Block diagrams are also extensively used in educational materials to explain complex concepts and systems in a simplified manner. They help in breaking down and visualizing scientific theories, engineering principles, and technological systems.']\n\nThese examples demonstrate the versatility of block diagrams in providing clear and concise representations of complex systems. Their simplicity and clarity make them a valuable tool for professionals across various fields to communicate complex ideas effectively.\n\nIn the following sections, we will delve into the specifics of creating and manipulating block diagrams using Mermaid, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced configurations and styling.\n\nCreating block diagrams with Mermaid is straightforward and accessible. This section introduces the basic syntax and structure needed to start building simple diagrams. Understanding these foundational concepts is key to efficiently utilizing Mermaid for more complex diagramming tasks.",
              "Simple Block Diagrams": {
                "Basic Structure": "At its core, a block diagram consists of blocks representing different entities or components. In Mermaid, these blocks are easily created using simple text labels. The most basic form of a block diagram can be a series of blocks without any connectors.\n\n**Example - Simple Block Diagram**:\nTo create a simple block diagram with three blocks labeled 'a', 'b', and 'c', the syntax is as follows:\n\n```\nblock\n  a b c\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  a b c\n```\n\nThis example will produce a horizontal sequence of three blocks. Each block is automatically spaced and aligned for optimal readability."
              },
              "Defining the number of columns to use": {
                "Column Usage": "While simple block diagrams are linear and straightforward, more complex systems may require a structured layout. Mermaid allows for the organization of blocks into multiple columns, facilitating the creation of more intricate and detailed diagrams.\n\n**Example - Multi-Column Diagram:**\nIn scenarios where you need to distribute blocks across multiple columns, you can specify the number of columns and arrange the blocks accordingly. Here's how to create a block diagram with three columns and four blocks, where the fourth block appears in a second row:\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  a b c d\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  a b c d\n```\n\nThis syntax instructs Mermaid to arrange the blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' across three columns, wrapping to the next row as needed. This feature is particularly useful for representing layered or multi-tiered systems, such as network layers or hierarchical structures.\n\nThese basic building blocks of Mermaid's block diagrams provide a foundation for more complex diagramming. The simplicity of the syntax allows for quick creation and iteration of diagrams, making it an efficient tool for visualizing ideas and concepts. In the next section, we'll explore advanced block configuration options, including setting block widths and creating composite blocks."
              }
            },
            "3. Advanced Block Configuration": {
              "Setting Block Width": {
                "Spanning Multiple Columns": "In more complex diagrams, you may need blocks that span multiple columns to emphasize certain components or to represent larger entities. Mermaid allows for the adjustment of block widths to cover multiple columns, enhancing the diagram's readability and structure.\n\n**Example - Block Spanning Multiple Columns**:\nTo create a block diagram where one block spans across two columns, you can specify the desired width for each block:\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  a[\"A label\"] b:2 c:2 d\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  a[\"A label\"] b:2 c:2 d\n```\n\nIn this example, the block labeled \"A labels\" spans one column, while blocks 'b', 'c' span 2 columns, and 'd' is again allocated its own column. This flexibility in block sizing is crucial for accurately representing systems with components of varying significance or size."
              },
              "Creating Composite Blocks": {
                "Nested Blocks": "Composite blocks, or blocks within blocks, are an advanced feature in Mermaid's block diagram syntax. They allow for the representation of nested or hierarchical systems, where one component encompasses several subcomponents.\n\n**Example - Composite Blocks:**\nCreating a composite block involves defining a parent block and then nesting other blocks within it. Here's how to define a composite block with nested elements:\n\n```\nblock\n    block\n      D\n    end\n    A[\"A: I am a wide one\"]\n```\n\n```\nblock\n    block\n      D\n    end\n    A[\"A: I am a wide one\"]\n```\n\nIn this syntax, 'D' is a nested block within a larger parent block. This feature is particularly useful for depicting complex structures, such as a server with multiple services or a department within a larger organizational framework."
              },
              "Column Width Dynamics": {
                "Adjusting Widths": "Mermaid also allows for dynamic adjustment of column widths based on the content of the blocks. The width of the columns is determined by the widest block in the column, ensuring that the diagram remains balanced and readable.\n\n**Example - Dynamic Column Widths:**\nIn diagrams with varying block sizes, Mermaid automatically adjusts the column widths to fit the largest block in each column. Here's an example:\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  a:3\n  block:group1:2\n    columns 2\n    h i j k\n  end\n  g\n  block:group2:3\n    %% columns auto (default)\n    l m n o p q r\n  end\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  a:3\n  block:group1:2\n    columns 2\n    h i j k\n  end\n  g\n  block:group2:3\n    %% columns auto (default)\n    l m n o p q r\n  end\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how Mermaid dynamically adjusts the width of the columns to accommodate the widest block, in this case, 'a' and the composite block 'e'. This dynamic adjustment is essential for creating visually balanced and easy-to-understand diagrams.\n\n**Merging Blocks Horizontally:**\nIn scenarios where you need to stack blocks horizontally, you can use column width to accomplish the task. Blocks can be arranged vertically by putting them in a single column. Here is how you can create a block diagram in which 4 blocks are stacked on top of each other:\n\n```\nblock\n  block\n    columns 1\n    a[\"A label\"] b c d\n  end\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  block\n    columns 1\n    a[\"A label\"] b c d\n  end\n```\n\nIn this example, the width of the merged block dynamically adjusts to the width of the largest child block.\n\nWith these advanced configuration options, Mermaid's block diagrams can be tailored to represent a wide array of complex systems and structures. The flexibility offered by these features enables users to create diagrams that are both informative and visually appealing. In the following sections, we will explore further capabilities, including different block shapes and linking options."

            "4. Block Varieties and Shapes": {
              "Standard and Special Block Shapes": "Discuss the various shapes available for blocks, including standard shapes and special forms like block arrows and space blocks.",
              "Block Arrows and Space Blocks": {
                "Example - Block Arrows": "Block arrows can visually indicate direction or flow within a process:\n\n```\nblock\n  blockArrowId<[\"Label\"]>(right)\n  blockArrowId2<[\"Label\"]>(left)\n  blockArrowId3<[\"Label\"]>(up)\n  blockArrowId4<[\"Label\"]>(down)\n  blockArrowId5<[\"Label\"]>(x)\n  blockArrowId6<[\"Label\"]>(y)\n  blockArrowId6<[\"Label\"]>(x, down)\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  blockArrowId<[\"Label\"]>(right)\n  blockArrowId2<[\"Label\"]>(left)\n  blockArrowId3<[\"Label\"]>(up)\n  blockArrowId4<[\"Label\"]>(down)\n  blockArrowId5<[\"Label\"]>(x)\n  blockArrowId6<[\"Label\"]>(y)\n  blockArrowId6<[\"Label\"]>(x, down)\n```",
                "Example - Space Blocks": "Space blocks can be used to create intentional empty spaces in the diagram, which is useful for layout and readability:\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  a space b\n  c   d   e\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  a space b\n  c   d   e\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nblock\n  ida space:3 idb idc\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  ida space:3 idb idc\n```\n\nNote that you can set how many columns the space block occupied using the number notation `space:num` where num is a number indicating the num columns width. You can also use `space` which defaults to one column.\n\nThe variety of shapes and special blocks in Mermaid enhances the expressive power of block diagrams, allowing for more accurate and context-specific representations. These options give users the flexibility to create diagrams that are both informative and visually appealing. In the next sections, we will explore the ways to connect these blocks and customize their appearance."
              }
            },
            "5. Connecting Blocks with Edges": {
              "Basic Linking and Arrow Types": "The most fundamental aspect of connecting blocks is the use of arrows or links. These connectors depict the relationships or the flow of information between the blocks. Mermaid offers a range of arrow types to suit different diagramming needs.\n\n**Example - Basic Links**\n\nA simple link with an arrow can be created to show direction or flow from one block to another:\n\n```\nblock\n  A space B\n  A-->B\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  A space B\n  A-->B\n```\n\nThis example illustrates a direct connection from block 'A' to block 'B', using a straightforward arrow.\n\nThis syntax creates a line connecting 'A' and 'B', implying a relationship or connection without indicating a specific direction.",
              "Text on Links": "In addition to connecting blocks, it's often necessary to describe or label the relationship. Mermaid allows for the inclusion of text on links, providing context to the connections.\n\nExample - Text with Links\nTo add text to a link, the syntax includes the text within the link definition:\n\n```\nblock\n  A space:2 B\n  A-- \"X\" -->B\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  A space:2 B\n  A-- \"X\" -->B\n```\n\nThis example show how to add descriptive text to the links, enhancing the information conveyed by the diagram.\n\nExample - Edges and Styles:\n\n```\nblock\ncolumns 1\n  db((\"DB\"))\n  blockArrowId6<[\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"]>(down)\n  block:ID\n    A\n    B[\"A wide one in the middle\"]\n    C\n  end\n  space\n  D\n  ID --> D\n  C --> D\n  style B fill:#939,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n```\n\n```\nblock\ncolumns 1\n  db((\"DB\"))\n  blockArrowId6<[\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"]>(down)\n  block:ID\n    A\n    B[\"A wide one in the middle\"]\n    C\n  end\n  space\n  D\n  ID --> D\n  C --> D\n  style B fill:#939,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n```"
            },
            "6. Styling and Customization": {
              "Individual Block Styling": {
                "Example - Styling a Single Block": "To apply custom styles to a block, you can use the `style` keyword followed by the block identifier and the desired CSS properties:\n\n```\nblock\n  id1 space id2\n  id1(\"Start\")-->id2(\"Stop\")\n  style id1 fill:#636,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n  style id2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  id1 space id2\n  id1(\"Start\")-->id2(\"Stop\")\n  style id1 fill:#636,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n  style id2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n```"
              },
              "Class Styling": {
                "Example - Styling a Single Class": "```\nblock\n  A space B\n  A-->B\n  classDef blue fill:#6e6ce6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\n  class A blue\n  style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  A space B\n  A-->B\n  classDef blue fill:#6e6ce6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\n  class A blue\n  style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n```\n\nIn this example, a class named 'blue' is defined and applied to block 'A', while block 'B' receives individual styling. This demonstrates the flexibility of Mermaid in applying both shared and unique styles within the same diagram.\n\nThe ability to style blocks individually or through classes provides a powerful tool for enhancing the visual impact and clarity of block diagrams. Whether emphasizing certain elements or maintaining a cohesive design across the diagram, these styling capabilities are central to effective diagramming. The next sections will present practical examples and use cases, followed by tips for troubleshooting common issues."
              },
              "7. Practical Examples and Use Cases": "The versatility of Mermaid's block diagrams becomes evident when applied to real-world scenarios. This section provides practical examples demonstrating the application of various features discussed in previous sections. These examples showcase how block diagrams can be used to represent complex systems and processes in an accessible and informative manner.",
              "Detailed Examples Illustrating Various Features": {
                "Example - System Architecture": "Illustrating a simple software system architecture with interconnected components:\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  Frontend blockArrowId6<[\" \"]>(right) Backend\n  space:2 down<[\" \"]>(down)\n  Disk left<[\" \"]>(left) Database[(\"Database\")]\n\n  classDef front fill:#696,stroke:#333;\n  classDef back fill:#969,stroke:#333;\n  class Frontend front\n  class Backend,Database back\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  Frontend blockArrowId6<[\" \"]>(right) Backend\n  space:2 down<[\" \"]>(down)\n  Disk left<[\" \"]>(left) Database[(\"Database\")]\n\n  classDef front fill:#696,stroke:#333;\n  classDef back fill:#969,stroke:#333;\n  class Frontend front\n  class Backend,Database back\n```\n\nThis example shows a basic architecture with a frontend, backend, and database. The blocks are styled to differentiate between types of components.",
                "Example - Business Process Flow": "Representing a business process flow with decision points and multiple stages:\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  Start((\"Start\")) space:2\n  down<[\" \"]>(down) space:2\n  Decision{{\"Make Decision\"}} right<[\"Yes\"]>(right) Process1[\"Process A\"]\n  downAgain<[\"No\"]>(down) space r3<[\"Done\"]>(down)\n  Process2[\"Process B\"] r2<[\"Done\"]>(right) End((\"End\"))\n\n  style Start fill:#969;\n  style End fill:#696;\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  columns 3\n  Start((\"Start\")) space:2\n  down<[\" \"]>(down) space:2\n  Decision{{\"Make Decision\"}} right<[\"Yes\"]>(right) Process1[\"Process A\"]\n  downAgain<[\"No\"]>(down) space r3<[\"Done\"]>(down)\n  Process2[\"Process B\"] r2<[\"Done\"]>(right) End((\"End\"))\n\n  style Start fill:#969;\n  style End fill:#696;\n```\n\nThese practical examples and scenarios underscore the utility of Mermaid block diagrams in simplifying and effectively communicating complex information across various domains.\n\nThe next section, 'Troubleshooting and Common Issues', will provide insights into resolving common challenges encountered when working with Mermaid block diagrams, ensuring a smooth diagramming experience."

            "8. Troubleshooting and Common Issues": {
              "Common Syntax Errors": {
                "Example - Incorrect Linking": "A common mistake is incorrect linking syntax, which can lead to unexpected results or broken diagrams:\n\n```\nblock\n  A - B\n```\n\n**Correction**:\nEnsure that links between blocks are correctly specified with arrows (--> or ---) to define the direction and type of connection. Also remember that one of the fundamentals for block diagram is to give the author full control of where the boxes are positioned so in the example you need to add a space between the boxes:\n\n```\nblock\n  A space B\n  A --> B\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  A space B\n  A --> B\n```",
                "Example - Misplaced Styling": "Applying styles in the wrong context or with incorrect syntax can lead to blocks not being styled as intended:\n\n```\n  block\n    A\n    style A fill#969;\n```\n\n```\n  block\n    A\n    style A fill#969;\n```\n\n**Correction:**\nCorrect the syntax by ensuring proper separation of style properties with commas and using the correct CSS property format:\n\n```\nblock\n  A\n  style A fill:#969,stroke:#333;\n\n```\n\n```\nblock\n  A\n  style A fill:#969,stroke:#333;\n\n```"
              },
              "Tips for Complex Diagram Structures": {
                "Modular Design": "Break down complex diagrams into smaller, more manageable components. This approach not only makes the diagram easier to understand but also simplifies the creation and maintenance process.",
                "Consistent Styling": "Use classes to maintain consistent styling across similar elements. This not only saves time but also ensures a cohesive and professional appearance.",
                "Comments and Documentation": "Use comments with `%%` within the Mermaid syntax to document the purpose of various parts of the diagram. This practice is invaluable for maintaining clarity, especially when working in teams or returning to a diagram after some time.\n\nWith these troubleshooting tips and best practices, you can effectively manage and resolve common issues in Mermaid block diagrams. The final section, 'Conclusion', will summarize the key points covered in this documentation and invite user feedback for continuous improvement."

The ones with `()` are treated as functions/methods, and all others as attributes.\n\nThere are two ways to define the members of a class, and regardless of whichever syntax is used to define the members, the output will still be same. The two different ways are :\n\n['Associate a member of a class using **:** (colon) followed by member name, useful to define one member at a time. For example:']\n\n```\nclassDiagram\nclass BankAccount\nBankAccount : +String owner\nBankAccount : +BigDecimal balance\nBankAccount : +deposit(amount)\nBankAccount : +withdrawal(amount)\n```\n\n```\nclassDiagram\nclass BankAccount\nBankAccount : +String owner\nBankAccount : +BigDecimal balance\nBankAccount : +deposit(amount)\nBankAccount : +withdrawal(amount)\n```\n\n['Associate members of a class using **{}** brackets, where members are grouped within curly brackets.

An example:\n\n```\nclassDiagram\nclass BankAccount{\n    +String owner\n    +BigDecimal balance\n    +deposit(amount) bool\n    +withdrawal(amount) int\n}\n```\n\n```\nclassDiagram\nclass BankAccount{\n    +String owner\n    +BigDecimal balance\n    +deposit(amount) bool\n    +withdrawal(amount) int\n}\n```\n\nGeneric Types\n\nGenerics can be represented as part of a class definition, and for class members/return types. In order to denote an item as generic, you enclose that type within `~` (**tilde**). **Nested** type declarations such as `List<List<int>>` are supported, though generics that include a comma are currently not supported. (such as `List<List<K, V>>`)\n\n['_note_ when a generic is used within a class definition, the generic type is NOT considered part of the class name. i.e.: for any syntax which required you to reference the class name, you need to drop the type part of the definition. This also means that mermaid does not currently support having two classes with the same name, but different generic types.']\n\n```\nclassDiagram\nclass Square~Shape~{\n    int id\n    List~int~ position\n    setPoints(List~int~ points)\n    getPoints() List~int~\n}\n\nSquare : -List~string~ messages\nSquare : +setMessages(List~string~ messages)\nSquare : +getMessages() List~string~\nSquare : +getDistanceMatrix() List~List~int~~\n```\n\n```\nclassDiagram\nclass Square~Shape~{\n    int id\n    List~int~ position\n    setPoints(List~int~ points)\n    getPoints() List~int~\n}\n\nSquare : -List~string~ messages\nSquare : +setMessages(List~string~ messages)\nSquare : +getMessages() List~string~\nSquare : +getDistanceMatrix() List~List~int~~\n```\n\nVisibility\n\nTo describe the visibility (or encapsulation) of an attribute or method/function that is a part of a class (i.e. a class member), optional notation may be placed before that members' name:\n\n['`+` Public', '`-` Private', '`#` Protected', '`~` Package/Internal']\n\n['_note_ you can also include additional _classifiers_ to a method definition by adding the following notation to the _end_ of the method, i.e.: after the `()` or after the return type:', ['`*` Abstract e.g.: `someAbstractMethod()*` or `someAbstractMethod() int*`', '`$` Static e.g.: `someStaticMethod()$` or `someStaticMethod() String$`']]\n\n['_note_ you can also include additional _classifiers_ to a field definition by adding the following notation to the very end:', ['`$` Static e.g.: `String someField$`']]",

In modelling this we might start out by observing that a `CAR` can be driven by many `PERSON` instances, and a `PERSON` can drive many `CAR`s - both entities can exist without the other, so this is a non-identifying relationship that we might specify in Mermaid as: `PERSON }|..|{ CAR : \"driver\"`. Note the two dots in the middle of the relationship that will result in a dashed line being drawn between the two entities.

The `name` values follow a similar format to `type`, but may start with an asterisk as another option to indicate an attribute is a primary key. Other than that, there are no restrictions, and there is no implicit set of valid data types.",

To specify multiple key constraints on a single attribute, separate them with a comma (e.g., `PK, FK`). A `comment` is defined by double quotes at the end of an attribute. Comments themselves cannot have double-quote characters in them.\n\n```\nerDiagram\n    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows\n    CAR {\n        string registrationNumber PK\n        string make\n        string model\n        string[] parts\n    }\n    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is\n    PERSON {\n        string driversLicense PK \"The license #\"\n        string(99) firstName \"Only 99 characters are allowed\"\n        string lastName\n        string phone UK\n        int age\n    }\n    NAMED-DRIVER {\n        string carRegistrationNumber PK, FK\n        string driverLicence PK, FK\n    }\n    MANUFACTURER only one to zero or more CAR : makes\n```\n\n```\nerDiagram\n    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows\n    CAR {\n        string registrationNumber PK\n        string make\n        string model\n        string[] parts\n    }\n    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is\n    PERSON {\n        string driversLicense PK \"The license #\"\n        string(99) firstName \"Only 99 characters are allowed\"\n        string lastName\n        string phone UK\n        int age\n    }\n    NAMED-DRIVER {\n        string carRegistrationNumber PK, FK\n        string driverLicence PK, FK\n    }\n    MANUFACTURER only one to zero or more CAR : makes\n```"

              "Adding custom commit id": "For a given commit you may specify a custom ID at the time of declaring it using the `id` attribute, followed by `:` and your custom value within a `\"\"` quote. For example: `commit id: \"your_custom_id\"`\n\nLet us see how this works with the help of the following diagram:\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit id: \"Alpha\"\n       commit id: \"Beta\"\n       commit id: \"Gamma\"\n```\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit id: \"Alpha\"\n       commit id: \"Beta\"\n       commit id: \"Gamma\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we have given our custom IDs to the commits.",
              "Modifying commit type": "In Mermaid, a commit can be of three type, which render a bit different in the diagram. These types are:\n\n['`NORMAL` : Default commit type. Represented by a solid circle in the diagram', '`REVERSE` : To emphasize a commit as a reverse commit. Represented by a crossed solid circle in the diagram.', '`HIGHLIGHT` : To highlight a particular commit in the diagram. Represented by a filled rectangle in the diagram.']\n\nFor a given commit you may specify its type at the time of declaring it using the `type` attribute, followed by `:` and the required type option discussed above. For example: `commit type: HIGHLIGHT`\n\nNOTE: If no commit type is specified, `NORMAL` is picked as default.\n\nLet us see how these different commit type look with the help of the following diagram:\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit id: \"Normal\"\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Reverse\" type: REVERSE\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Highlight\" type: HIGHLIGHT\n       commit\n```\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit id: \"Normal\"\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Reverse\" type: REVERSE\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Highlight\" type: HIGHLIGHT\n       commit\n```\n\nIn this example, we have specified different types to each commit. Also, see how we have included both `id` and `type` together at the time of declaring our commits.",
              "Adding Tags": "For a given commit you may decorate it as a **tag**, similar to the concept of tags or release version in git world.\nYou can attach a custom tag at the time of declaring a commit using the `tag` attribute, followed by `:` and your custom value within `\"\"` quote. For example: `commit tag: \"your_custom_tag\"`\n\nLet us see how this works with the help of the following diagram:\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Normal\" tag: \"v1.0.0\"\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Reverse\" type: REVERSE tag: \"RC_1\"\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Highlight\" type: HIGHLIGHT tag: \"8.8.4\"\n       commit\n```\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Normal\" tag: \"v1.0.0\"\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Reverse\" type: REVERSE tag: \"RC_1\"\n       commit\n       commit id: \"Highlight\" type: HIGHLIGHT tag: \"8.8.4\"\n       commit\n```\n\nIn this example, we have given custom tags to the commits. Also, see how we have combined all these attributes in a single commit declaration. You can mix-match these attributes as you like.",
              "Create a new branch": "In Mermaid, in-order to create a new branch, you make use of the `branch` keyword. You also need to provide a name of the new branch. The name has to be unique and cannot be that of an existing branch. A branch name that could be confused for a keyword must be quoted within `\"\"`. Usage examples: `branch develop`, `branch \"cherry-pick\"`\n\nWhen Mermaid, reads the `branch` keyword, it creates a new branch and sets it as the current branch. Equivalent to you creating a new branch and checking it out in Git world.\n\nLet see this in an example:\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit\n       commit\n       branch develop\n       commit\n       commit\n       commit\n```\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit\n       commit\n       branch develop\n       commit\n       commit\n       commit\n```\n\nIn this example, see how we started with default `main` branch, and pushed two commits on that.\nThen we created the `develop` branch, and all commits afterwards are put on the `develop` branch as it became the current branch.",
              "Checking out an existing branch": "In Mermaid, in order to switch to an existing branch, you make use of the `checkout` keyword. You also need to provide a name of an existing branch. If no branch is found with the given name, it will result in console error. Usage example: `checkout develop`\n\nWhen Mermaid, reads the `checkout` keyword, it finds the given branch and sets it as the current branch. Equivalent to checking out a branch in the Git world.\n\nLet see modify our previous example:\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit\n       commit\n       branch develop\n       commit\n       commit\n       commit\n       checkout main\n       commit\n       commit\n```\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit\n       commit\n       branch develop\n       commit\n       commit\n       commit\n       checkout main\n       commit\n       commit\n```\n\nIn this example, see how we started with default `main` branch, and pushed two commits on that.\nThen we created the `develop` branch, and all three commits afterwards are put on the `develop` branch as it became the current branch.\nAfter this we made use of the `checkout` keyword to set the current branch as `main`, and all commit that follow are registered against the current branch, i.e. `main`.",
              "Merging two branches": "In Mermaid, in order to merge or join to an existing branch, you make use of the `merge` keyword. You also need to provide the name of an existing branch to merge from. If no branch is found with the given name, it will result in console error. Also, you can only merge two separate branches, and cannot merge a branch with itself. In such case an error is throw.\n\nUsage example: `merge develop`\n\nWhen Mermaid, reads the `merge` keyword, it finds the given branch and its head commit (the last commit on that branch), and joins it with the head commit on the **current branch**. Each merge results in a **_merge commit_**, represented in the diagram with **filled double circle**.\n\nLet us modify our previous example to merge our two branches:\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit\n       commit\n       branch develop\n       commit\n       commit\n       commit\n       checkout main\n       commit\n       commit\n       merge develop\n       commit\n       commit\n```\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit\n       commit\n       branch develop\n       commit\n       commit\n       commit\n       checkout main\n       commit\n       commit\n       merge develop\n       commit\n       commit\n```\n\nIn this example, see how we started with default `main` branch, and pushed two commits on that.\nThen we created the `develop` branch, and all three commits afterwards are put on the `develop` branch as it became the current branch.\nAfter this we made use of the `checkout` keyword to set the current branch as `main`, and all commits that follow are registered against the current branch, i.e. `main`.\nAfter this we merge the `develop` branch onto the current branch `main`, resulting in a merge commit.\nSince the current branch at this point is still `main`, the last two commits are registered against that.\n\nYou can also decorate your merge with similar attributes as you did for the commit using:\n\n['`id`--> To override the default ID with custom ID', '`tag`--> To add a custom tag to your merge commit', '`type`--> To override the default shape of merge commit. Here you can use other commit type mentioned earlier.']\n\nAnd you can choose to use none, some or all of these attributes together.\nFor example: `merge develop id: \"my_custom_id\" tag: \"my_custom_tag\" type: REVERSE`\n\nLet us see how this works with the help of the following diagram:\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit id: \"1\"\n       commit id: \"2\"\n       branch nice_feature\n       checkout nice_feature\n       commit id: \"3\"\n       checkout main\n       commit id: \"4\"\n       checkout nice_feature\n       branch very_nice_feature\n       checkout very_nice_feature\n       commit id: \"5\"\n       checkout main\n       commit id: \"6\"\n       checkout nice_feature\n       commit id: \"7\"\n       checkout main\n       merge nice_feature id: \"customID\" tag: \"customTag\" type: REVERSE\n       checkout very_nice_feature\n       commit id: \"8\"\n       checkout main\n       commit id: \"9\"\n```\n\n```\n    gitGraph\n       commit id: \"1\"\n       commit id: \"2\"\n       branch nice_feature\n       checkout nice_feature\n       commit id: \"3\"\n       checkout main\n       commit id: \"4\"\n       checkout nice_feature\n       branch very_nice_feature\n       checkout very_nice_feature\n       commit id: \"5\"\n       checkout main\n       commit id: \"6\"\n       checkout nice_feature\n       commit id: \"7\"\n       checkout main\n       merge nice_feature id: \"customID\" tag: \"customTag\" type: REVERSE\n       checkout very_nice_feature\n       commit id: \"8\"\n       checkout main\n       commit id: \"9\"\n```",
              "Cherry Pick commit from another branch": "Similar to how 'git' allows you to cherry-pick a commit from **another branch** onto the **current** branch, Mermaid also supports this functionality. You can also cherry-pick a commit from another branch using the `cherry-pick` keyword.\n\nTo use the `cherry-pick` keyword, you must specify the id using the `id` attribute, followed by `:` and your desired commit id within a `\"\"` quote. For example:\n\n`cherry-pick id: \"your_custom_id\"`\n\nHere, a new commit representing the cherry-pick is created on the current branch, and is visually highlighted in the diagram with a **cherry** and a tag depicting the commit id from which it is cherry-picked from.\n\nA few important rules to note here are:\n\n['You need to provide the `id` for an existing commit to be cherry-picked. If given commit id does not exist it will result in an error. For this, make use of the `commit id:$value` format of declaring commits.

            "Defining Columns": "Columns represent the different stages in your workflow, such as “Todo,” “In Progress,” “Done,” etc. Each column is defined using a unique identifier and a title enclosed in square brackets.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```\ncolumnId[Column Title]\n```\n\n['columnId: A unique identifier for the column.', '\\\\[Column Title]: The title displayed on the column header.']\n\nLike this `id1[Todo]`",
            "Adding Tasks to Columns": "Tasks are listed under their respective columns with an indentation. Each task also has a unique identifier and a description enclosed in square brackets.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```\ntaskId[Task Description]\n```\n\n```\n•   taskId: A unique identifier for the task.\n•   [Task Description]: The description of the task.\n```\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\ndocs[Create Documentation]\n```",
            "Adding Metadata to Tasks": "You can include additional metadata for each task using the @{ ... } syntax. Metadata can contain key-value pairs like assigned, ticket, priority, etc. This will be rendered added to the rendering of the node.",
            "Supported Metadata Keys": "```\n•   assigned: Specifies who is responsible for the task.\n•   ticket: Links the task to a ticket or issue number.\n•   priority: Indicates the urgency of the task. Allowed values: 'Very High', 'High', 'Low' and 'Very Low'\n```\n\n```\nkanban\ntodo[Todo]\n  id3[Update Database Function]@{ ticket: MC-2037, assigned: 'knsv', priority: 'High' }\n```\n\n```\nkanban\ntodo[Todo]\n  id3[Update Database Function]@{ ticket: MC-2037, assigned: 'knsv', priority: 'High' }\n```",
            "Configuration Options": "You can customize the Kanban diagram using a configuration block at the beginning of your markdown file. This is useful for setting global settings like a base URL for tickets. Currently there is one configuration option for kanban diagrams `ticketBaseUrl`. This can be set as in the following example:\n\n```\n---\nconfig:\n  kanban:\n    ticketBaseUrl: 'https://yourproject.atlassian.net/browse/#TICKET#'\n---\n```\n\nWhen the kanban item has an assigned ticket number the ticket number in the diagram will have a link to an external system where the ticket is defined. The `ticketBaseUrl` sets the base URL to the external system and #TICKET# is replaced with the ticket value from task metadata to create a valid link.",

Start by using the kanban keyword to initiate the diagram. Define your columns with unique identifiers and titles to represent different stages of your project. Under each column, list your tasks—also with unique identifiers—and provide detailed descriptions as needed. Remember that proper indentation is crucial; tasks must be indented under their parent columns to maintain the correct structure.\n\nYou can enhance your diagram by adding optional metadata to tasks using the @{ ... } syntax, which allows you to include additional context such as assignee, ticket numbers, and priority levels. For further customization, utilize the configuration block at the top of your file to set global options like ticketBaseUrl for linking tickets directly from your diagram.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines—ensuring unique identifiers, proper indentation, and utilizing metadata and configuration options—you can create a comprehensive and customized Kanban board that effectively maps out your project’s workflow using Mermaid."

You can name a composite state on a separate line just like a simple state.

            "Syntax": "The syntax for creating Timeline diagram is simple. You always start with the `timeline` keyword to let mermaid know that you want to create a timeline diagram.\n\nAfter that there is a possibility to add a title to the timeline. This is done by adding a line with the keyword `title` followed by the title text.\n\nThen you add the timeline data, where you always start with a time period, followed by a colon and then the text for the event. Optionally you can add a second colon and then the text for the event. So, you can have one or more events per time period.\n\n```\n{time period} : {event}\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n{time period} : {event} : {event}\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n{time period} : {event}\n              : {event}\n              : {event}\n```\n\n**NOTE**: Both time period and event are simple text, and not limited to numbers.\n\nLet us look at the syntax for the example above.\n\n```\ntimeline\n    title History of Social Media Platform\n    2002 : LinkedIn\n    2004 : Facebook : Google\n    2005 : YouTube\n    2006 : Twitter\n```\n\n```\ntimeline\n    title History of Social Media Platform\n    2002 : LinkedIn\n    2004 : Facebook : Google\n    2005 : YouTube\n    2006 : Twitter\n```\n\nIn this way we can use a text outline to generate a timeline diagram.\nThe sequence of time period and events is important, as it will be used to draw the timeline. The first time period will be placed at the left side of the timeline, and the last time period will be placed at the right side of the timeline.\n\nSimilarly, the first event will be placed at the top for that specific time period, and the last event will be placed at the bottom.",
            "Grouping of time periods in sections/ages": "You can group time periods in sections/ages. This is done by adding a line with the keyword `section` followed by the section name.\n\nAll subsequent time periods will be placed in this section until a new section is defined.\n\nIf no section is defined, all time periods will be placed in the default section.\n\nLet us look at an example, where we have grouped the time periods in sections.\n\n```\ntimeline\n    title Timeline of Industrial Revolution\n    section 17th-20th century\n        Industry 1.0 : Machinery, Water power, Steam <br>power\n        Industry 2.0 : Electricity, Internal combustion engine, Mass production\n        Industry 3.0 : Electronics, Computers, Automation\n    section 21st century\n        Industry 4.0 : Internet, Robotics, Internet of Things\n        Industry 5.0 : Artificial intelligence, Big data, 3D printing\n```\n\n```\ntimeline\n    title Timeline of Industrial Revolution\n    section 17th-20th century\n        Industry 1.0 : Machinery, Water power, Steam <br>power\n        Industry 2.0 : Electricity, Internal combustion engine, Mass production\n        Industry 3.0 : Electronics, Computers, Automation\n    section 21st century\n        Industry 4.0 : Internet, Robotics, Internet of Things\n        Industry 5.0 : Artificial intelligence, Big data, 3D printing\n```\n\nAs you can see, the time periods are placed in the sections, and the sections are placed in the order they are defined.\n\nAll time periods and events under a given section follow a similar color scheme. This is done to make it easier to see the relationship between time periods and events.",
            "Wrapping of text for long time-periods or events": "By default, the text for time-periods and events will be wrapped if it is too long. This is done to avoid that the text is drawn outside the diagram.\n\nYou can also use `<br>` to force a line break.\n\nLet us look at another example, where we have a long time period, and a long event.\n\n```\ntimeline\n        title England's History Timeline\n        section Stone Age\n          7600 BC : Britain's oldest known house was built in Orkney, Scotland\n          6000 BC : Sea levels rise and Britain becomes an island.<br> The people who live here are hunter-gatherers.\n        section Bronze Age\n          2300 BC : People arrive from Europe and settle in Britain. <br>They bring farming and metalworking.\n                  : New styles of pottery and ways of burying the dead appear.\n          2200 BC : The last major building works are completed at Stonehenge.<br> People now bury their dead in stone circles.\n                  : The first metal objects are made in Britain.Some other nice things happen. it is a good time to be alive.\n\n```\n\n```\ntimeline\n        title England's History Timeline\n        section Stone Age\n          7600 BC : Britain's oldest known house was built in Orkney, Scotland\n          6000 BC : Sea levels rise and Britain becomes an island.<br> The people who live here are hunter-gatherers.\n        section Bronze Age\n          2300 BC : People arrive from Europe and settle in Britain. <br>They bring farming and metalworking.\n                  : New styles of pottery and ways of burying the dead appear.\n          2200 BC : The last major building works are completed at Stonehenge.<br> People now bury their dead in stone circles.\n                  : The first metal objects are made in Britain.Some other nice things happen. it is a good time to be alive.\n\n```\n\n```\ntimeline\n        title MermaidChart 2023 Timeline\n        section 2023 Q1 <br> Release Personal Tier\n          Bullet 1 : sub-point 1a : sub-point 1b\n               : sub-point 1c\n          Bullet 2 : sub-point 2a : sub-point 2b\n        section 2023 Q2 <br> Release XYZ Tier\n          Bullet 3 : sub-point <br> 3a : sub-point 3b\n               : sub-point 3c\n          Bullet 4 : sub-point 4a : sub-point 4b\n```\n\n```\ntimeline\n        title MermaidChart 2023 Timeline\n        section 2023 Q1 <br> Release Personal Tier\n          Bullet 1 : sub-point 1a : sub-point 1b\n               : sub-point 1c\n          Bullet 2 : sub-point 2a : sub-point 2b\n        section 2023 Q2 <br> Release XYZ Tier\n          Bullet 3 : sub-point <br> 3a : sub-point 3b\n               : sub-point 3c\n          Bullet 4 : sub-point 4a : sub-point 4b\n```",

              "Customizing Color scheme": "You can customize the color scheme using the `cScale0` to `cScale11` theme variables, which will change the background colors. Mermaid allows you to set unique colors for up-to 12 sections, where `cScale0` variable will drive the value of the first section or time-period, `cScale1` will drive the value of the second section and so on.\nIn case you have more than 12 sections, the color scheme will start to repeat.\n\nIf you also want to change the foreground color of a section, you can do so use theme variables corresponding `cScaleLabel0` to `cScaleLabel11` variables.\n\n**NOTE**: Default values for these theme variables are picked from the selected theme. If you want to override the default values, you can use the `initialize` call to add your custom theme variable values.\n\nExample:\n\nNow let's override the default values for the `cScale0` to `cScale2` variables:\n\n```\n---\nconfig:\n  logLevel: 'debug'\n  theme: 'default'\n  themeVariables:\n    cScale0: '#ff0000'\n    cScaleLabel0: '#ffffff'\n    cScale1: '#00ff00'\n    cScale2: '#0000ff'\n    cScaleLabel2: '#ffffff'\n---\n       timeline\n        title History of Social Media Platform\n          2002 : LinkedIn\n          2004 : Facebook : Google\n          2005 : YouTube\n          2006 : Twitter\n          2007 : Tumblr\n          2008 : Instagram\n          2010 : Pinterest\n\n```\n\n```\n---\nconfig:\n  logLevel: 'debug'\n  theme: 'default'\n  themeVariables:\n    cScale0: '#ff0000'\n    cScaleLabel0: '#ffffff'\n    cScale1: '#00ff00'\n    cScale2: '#0000ff'\n    cScaleLabel2: '#ffffff'\n---\n       timeline\n        title History of Social Media Platform\n          2002 : LinkedIn\n          2004 : Facebook : Google\n          2005 : YouTube\n          2006 : Twitter\n          2007 : Tumblr\n          2008 : Instagram\n          2010 : Pinterest\n\n```\n\nSee how the colors are changed to the values specified in the theme variables."

This option primarily uses [D3's format specifiers](https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format) to control how numbers are displayed, with some additional special cases for common formats.\n\nSome common format patterns:\n\n['`,` - Thousands separator (default)', '`$` - Add dollar sign', '`.1f` - Show one decimal place', '`.1%` - Show as percentage with one decimal place', '`$0,0` - Dollar sign with thousands separator', '`$.2f` - Dollar sign with 2 decimal places', '`$,.2f` - Dollar sign with thousands separator and 2 decimal places']\n\nThe treemap diagram supports both standard D3 format specifiers and some common currency formats that combine the dollar sign with other formatting options.\n\nExample with currency formatting:\n\n```\n---\nconfig:\n  treemap:\n    valueFormat: '$0,0'\n---\ntreemap-beta\n\"Budget\"\n    \"Operations\"\n        \"Salaries\": 700000\n        \"Equipment\": 200000\n        \"Supplies\": 100000\n    \"Marketing\"\n        \"Advertising\": 400000\n        \"Events\": 100000\n```\n\n```\n---\nconfig:\n  treemap:\n    valueFormat: '$0,0'\n---\ntreemap-beta\n\"Budget\"\n    \"Operations\"\n        \"Salaries\": 700000\n        \"Equipment\": 200000\n        \"Supplies\": 100000\n    \"Marketing\"\n        \"Advertising\": 400000\n        \"Events\": 100000\n```\n\nExample with percentage formatting:\n\n```\n---\nconfig:\n  treemap:\n    valueFormat: '$.1%'\n---\ntreemap-beta\n\"Market Share\"\n    \"Company A\": 0.35\n    \"Company B\": 0.25\n    \"Company C\": 0.15\n    \"Others\": 0.25\n```\n\n```\n---\nconfig:\n  treemap:\n    valueFormat: '$.1%'\n---\ntreemap-beta\n\"Market Share\"\n    \"Company A\": 0.35\n    \"Company B\": 0.25\n    \"Company C\": 0.15\n    \"Others\": 0.25\n```"

            "Common Use Cases": "Treemap diagrams are commonly used for:\n\n['**Financial Data**: Visualizing budget allocations, market shares, or portfolio compositions', '**File System Analysis**: Showing disk space usage by folders and files', '**Population Demographics**: Displaying population distribution across regions and subregions', '**Product Hierarchies**: Visualizing product categories and their sales volumes', '**Organizational Structures**: Representing departments and team sizes in a company']",
            "Limitations": [
              "Treemap diagrams work best when the data has a natural hierarchy",
              "Very small values may be difficult to see or label in a treemap diagram",
              "Deep hierarchies (many levels) can be challenging to represent clearly",
              "Treemap diagrams are not well suited for representing data with negative values"
            ],
            "Related Diagrams": "If treemap diagrams don't suit your needs, consider these alternatives:\n\n['[**Pie Charts**](./pie.md): For simple proportion comparisons without hierarchy', '**Sunburst Diagrams**: For hierarchical data with a radial layout (yet to be released in Mermaid).', '[**Sankey Diagrams**](./sankey.md): For flow-based hierarchical data']",
            "Notes": "The treemap diagram implementation in Mermaid is designed to be simple to use while providing powerful visualization capabilities. As this is a newer diagram type, feedback and feature requests are welcome through the Mermaid GitHub repository."
